vehicles (EVs) contributes to a wide range of sustainability goals. These \ninclude better air quality, reduced noise pollution, enhanced energy security, and reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions among others. With vehicular pollution being a growing source of air \npollution in Chandigarh and contributing substantially to particulate pollution in city, rapid adoption \nof zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles is essential. \nThe government adopted the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV (FAME) scheme . \nThe low penetration of electric vehicles is largely due to four critical barriers: \na) High upfront purchase price of EVs \nb) Limited EV product offerings comparable to ICE vehicles \nc) Inadequate public charging infrastructure \nd) Low levels of awareness about EVs and their benefits. \n \nThe slow uptake of EVs and the changing policy, technology, and market landscape have created a \nneed for the Chandigarh Administration to draft its EV Policy, in order to accelerate EV adoption in \nthe UT. This policy prioritizes public and shared transport, goods carriers and two-wheelers to drive \nadoption of EVs. \n \n1. Definitions \n1.1 Electric Vehicle (EV) \nAll vehicles with advanced batteries (both fixed and swappable) having passed all the \neligibility and testing conditions as specified under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of \n(Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME-II) scheme AND purchased & registered in \nChandigarh shall be eligible for incentives. Any conditions/specifications/inclusions/exclusions \nother than FAME II are either specified in this policy or shall be separately notified by CREST \nfrom time to time. \n1.2 Retrofit Kits \nRetrofit kits eligible for incentives under this policy include kits for conversion from ICE to \nadvanced battery-operated Electric Vehicles and shall be approved by a competent agency \nunder Rule 126 of CMVR, 1989 or as notified by the Transport Department, Chandigarh \nGovernment. \n1.3 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)  \nElectric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) shall mean an element in Electric Vehicle (EV) \ncharging infrastructure that supplies electric energy for recharging the battery of Electric \nVehicles.

Number 360/2018 to \ncheck compliance with several statutory requirements related to waste and environment \nmanagement and advisories issued in the states. This order was passed in response to the \ngrowing concerns regarding non-compliance with the provisions of Waste Management Rules \nand Regulations of 2016, and other relevant rules and regulations related to water quality and \nconservation, and air and noise pollution management in the states. Central Pollution Control \nBoard (CPCB) summarized 7 themes from the order of 26thSeptember 2019 that had directed \nthe state governments to compile information with reference to the following specific thematic \nareas viz.:  \n1. Waste Management: \n \n▪ \nSolid Waste \n▪ \nBiomedical Waste \n▪ \nConstruction & Demolition Waste \n▪ \nHazardous Waste \n▪ \nE-Waste \n▪ \nPlastic Waste \n \n2. Water Quality Management. \n \n3. Ambient Air Quality. \n \n4. Domestic Sewage. \n \n5. Industrial Waste Water. \n \n6. Mining Activity \n \n7. Noise Pollution \n \nThis order has directed that such information is to be furnished to the CPCB \nby the Chief Secretaries of all the States/UTs. This may include current status, desirable level \nof compliance in terms of statutes, and gap between current status and desired levels. The \naction proposal needs to address the gap with an action plan including time lines. The \n2 \n \nDepartment of Environment of all States and Union Territories are required to collect such \nDistrict Environment Plans of their respective States and finalize the ‘State Environment Plan’ \ncovering the specific thematic areas. The action for preparation of State’s Environment Plan \nshall be monitored by the respective Chief Secretaries of States and Administration of UTs. \nBased on the Environment Plans of the States and UTs, the Ministry of Environment and \nForests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and CPCB shall prepare country’s Environment \nPlan accordingly.  \nThus, as per the hearing of Hon’ble NGT on 29.01.2021, the State \nGovernments are required to submit a State Environment Plan (SEP) to take stock of the \ncompliance with the statutory provisions and the action plan to safeguard against health risk \nand environmental degradation. Following this order, the Department of Environment, U.T., \nChandigarh has prepared the DEP by compiling information from Municipal Committee, \nChandigarh; Pollution Control Committee, Chandigarh and Chandigarh Smart City Limited as \nper the seven thematic areas. Being a Union Territory, State Environment Plan & District \nEnvironment Plan shall be same for Chandigarh. \n \nThe \nDistrict \nMagistrate, \nU.T. \nChandigarh \nvide \nMemo \nNo. \nDM/MA/2021/3733, dated 25.02.2021 has appointed the A.D.A. posted in the office of the \nDistrict Magistrate as the Nodal Officer w.r.t. the order dated 29.01.2021, passed by the \nHon’ble N.G.T. in the case- “O.A. no. 360 of 2018.

The noise levels are maintained at these locations as per Noise Pollution \n(Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n1.0 District Profile: \nChandigarh was planned by the famous French architect Le Corbusier. \nPicturesquely located at the foothills of Shivaliks, it is known as one of the best experiments \nin urban planning and modern architecture in the twentieth century in India. Chandigarh \nderives its name from the temple of \"Chandi Mandir\" located in the vicinity of the site selected \nfor the city. The deity 'Chandi', the goddess of power and a fort of 'garh' laying beyond the \ntemple gave the city its name \"Chandigarh-The City Beautiful\".  \nSince the medieval through modern era, the area was part of the large and \nprosperous Punjab Province which was divided into East & West Punjab during partition of \nthe country in 1947. The city was conceived not only to serve as the capital of East Punjab, \nbut also to resettle thousands of refugees who had been uprooted from West Punjab.In March, \n1948, the Government of Punjab, in consultation with the Government of India, approved the \narea of the foothills of the Shivaliks as the site for the new capital. The location of the city site \nwas a part of the erstwhile Ambala district as per the 1892-93 gazetteer of District Ambala. \nThe foundation stone of the city was laid in 1952. Subsequently, at the time of \nreorganization of the state on 01.11.1966 into Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pardesh, the city \nassumed the unique distinction of being the capital city of both, Punjab and Haryana while it \nitself was declared as a Union Territory and under the direct control of the Central Government. \nThe Master Plan of UT Chandigarh covers an area of approximately 114 sq km \n(excluding 26 km area of Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary). This includes the nearly fully developed \n70 sq km of the area planned by Le Corbusier and his team and the 44 sq km of its 3% share of \nthe 16 km periphery-controlled area. The 44 sq km periphery area of Chandigarh is regulated \nby the Punjab New Periphery Control Act, 1952 with the exception of the abadideh of the \nvillages falling within it namely Sarangpur, Khudda Ali Sher, Khudda Jassu, Khudda Lahora, \nMaloya, Dadumajra,Palsora, Kajheri, Raipur Kalan, Raipur Khurd, Behlana, Hallomajra, \nMakhanmajra, Kishangarh and Manimajra. The area also includes the three natural rivulets of \nthe Patiala Ki Rao, N-Choe and the Sukhna Choe. As per the exact cartographic extent, \nChandigarh is from30°40′N to 30º47'30\"N and from 76°42′15\"E to 76º51'E.  It has an average \nelevation of 320 metres and shares its borders with the states of Haryana and Punjab. \nThe Union Territory of Chandigarh is located in the foothills of the Shivalik hill \nranges in the north, which form a part of the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. It is occupied by \n9 \n \nKandi (Bhabhar) in the north east and Sirowal (Tarai) and alluvial plains in the remaining part. \nThe subsurface formation comprises of beds of boulders, pebbles, gravel, sand, silt, clays and \nsome kankar. The area is drained by two seasonal rivulets viz. Sukhna Choe in the east and \nPatiala-Ki-Rao Choe in the west. The central part forms a surface water divide and has two \nminor streams. The stream passing through the central part is called N-Choe and the other is \nChoe Nala which initiates at Sector29. \nThere are two Eco Sensitive Zones notified in the Union Territory of \nChandigarh, namely Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary Eco Sensitive Zone and City Bird Sanctuary \nEco Sensitive Zone. The extent of zone for the former varies from 2.0 kilometres to 2.75 \nkilometres from the boundary of the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary in the city. The Administration \nhas divided the Eco-sensitive Zone in two zones i. e., Zone-I and Zone II. The extent of Zone-\nI is upto 0.5 km of from the boundary of the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary and the balance area \nshall be in Zone-II and this has been done with the purpose of having stricter norms in Zone-I \nfor protection of wildlife habitat. The area of Eco-sensitive Zone is 1050.0 hectares (on the side \nof Union territory of Chandigarh). The Central Government has also notified an area to an \nextent varying from 80 to 125 meters from the boundary of the City Bird Sanctuary Union \nTerritory Chandigarh as the City Bird Sanctuary Eco-Sensitive Zone. \nWith total area of 140 sq. km, Chandigarh is blessed with 63.03 sq. km. of green \ncover which is 50.05% of UT's total area. The forest area of UT Chandigarh is 22.03 sq. km \nwhich is 19.32 % of geographical area (114 sq km) and another 25.98 sq. km. area of Sukhna \nWildlife Sanctuary.  In the last two decades, city has observed 39% increase in green cover. \nAmple areas have been provided in the master plan of the Capital for parks. Out \nof a total area of 20,000 acres acquired for the first phase, about 2000 acres are meant for \ndevelopment of parks. Leisure Valley, Rajendra Park, Bougainvillea Park, Zakir Rose Garden, \nShanti Kunj, Hibiscus Garden, Garden of Fragrance, Botanical Garden, Smriti Upavan, \nTopiary Garden and Terraced Garden are some of the famous parks of Chandigarh.

As the numbers of agricultural \nland holdings are very few, the use of harmful chemicals that have potent lethal effects on \nland and water is very much under control. Thus the water quality of Chandigarh lies well \nwithin limits as prescribed by the BIS standards of drinking water. Water analysis conducted \nby the Central Ground Water Board in both deep and shallow aquifers shows the absence of \nheavy metals and any such impurities. \nThe present water supply service area of Municipal Corporations Chandigarh \n(MCC) is 114 Sq.Km, which includes MCC area of 79.34 Sq.Km and rural area of 34.69 \nSq.Km. The urban area falls in jurisdiction of Municipal Corporation and the water supply \nsystem is entrusted to Public Health Wing of MCC. The rural area comprises of 13 villages \noverseen by the Engineering Department. The water supply to the villages is provided with \ntube wells in and around the villages. Other urban/rural areas have water source of 87MGD \n(Millions of Gallons per day) from Bhakra Main Canal which is 27 km away from \nChandigarh and 20 MGD from 230 tube-well located in the city. \n \nChandigarh is recipient to heavy rainfall during the months from July to \nSeptember and receives an average rainfall of 1059.3 mm, which is calculated to be \napproximately 60380.1 million liters or 13241 gallons or 36.28 MGD per annum. It is this \nwater source that helps in recharging of ground water and various confined/ unconfined \naquifers. The demand for water in Chandigarh has increased considerably owing to its \nhighly dense population structure. It is estimated that by 2026, the water demand will be \n523.41 (Millions of liters per day) MLD (116.31 MGD) that is about 22.73% higher than \nthe 2011 demand of 426.50 MLD (94.78 MGD). This is due to excessive pumping of water \nthan the required replenishment.

The Executive Engineer clarified that \nthe \nMunicipal \nCorporation \nChandigarh is allowed to do work \ninside the \"Lal Dora\" area only and is \nrestricted to carry out work outside \nthe \"Lal Dora\" area. But, as the matter \nrelates to \ncompliance of NGT \nguidelines, he proposed a plan that \nnecessitates a 7-meter wide strip of \n77 \n \nland on both sides of the choe for the \ninstallation of the main sewer line. \nAdditionally, land is also required for \nthe construction of a sewerage sump, \nwhich would serve as the point from \nwhere waste is pumped into the main \nsewer line for treatment at the STP \nDiggian. The land will be made \navailable for execution of work free \nof cost to the Municipal Corporation \nChandigarh. \n \nc. In response to point (b), the residents \nhave requested some time to consider \nthe proposal and will revert back with \ntheir decision. \nd. The \nSub \nDivisional \nMagistrate \nintimated that if the waste water \ncontinues to flow into the choe, they \nwill have no alternative but to proceed \nwith the demolition of the illegal \nconstruction on the agricultural land, \nin compliance with the Hon’ble NGT \norder.  \ne.

The major shortcoming in the action \nplan was highlighted before the Committee which are as follows: \n Authorisation to all the Health Care Facilities (HCFs) \n Implementation of Bar Code System for the management of biomedical \nwaste in Chandigarh. \n Gap analysis w.r.t. biomedical waste generation and disposal \n Liquid waste management in HCFs \n \n \nNodal Officer apprised that Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee \n(CPCC) has granted authorisation to around 719 nos. of HCFs out of total 858 \nnos. of HCFs. It was decided that the remaining HCFs will be issued final show \ncause notice by CPCC before proceeding for the confirmation of directions under \nMinutes of the District Committee for Biomedical Waste Management \nSection 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Director Health Services was \nasked to convene a meeting with the remaining HCFs those who have not taken \nauthorisation from CPCC under Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016. \nMunicipal Corporation Chandigarh was asked to implement the Biomedical \nWaste Management Rules, 2016 by picking up the domestic biomedical waste in \nseparate containers from the household level and make an agreement with \nCommon Biomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility (CBWTF) for the \ndisposal of collected household biomedical waste. Nodal Officer also apprised to \nthe Committee members that presently Chandigarh city is generating around 3400 \nkilograms of biomedical waste per day which will not touch the figures of 6000 \nkilograms per day in next ten years. The present treatment capacity of the \nBiomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility is 6000 kgs. of biomedical \nwaste per day. Hence, there is no gap in the generation and disposal of \nbiomedical waste in Chandigarh. It was also apprised that most of the \ngovernment hospitals are in the process of tendering for the installation of \neffluent treatment plant (ETP) and implementation of bar code management \nsystem in their hospitals. During the meeting it was decided that all the hospitals \nwill be asked to speed up the process of installation of ETPs and Bar Code \nManagement System. \n \n \nThe meeting ended with thanks to the chair. \n \n \nDistrict Magistrate \nU.T.

This is rainfall \nperennial lake and serves as natural water storage during the monsoon \nseason. It falls within the Reserve Forest Area of Patiala-Ki-Rao, UT. \nChandigarh, the map has been shown in (Figure 1) and location of the \nwater body Latitude-30°45'59.50\"N Longitude-76°45'25.53\"E. This water \nbody is in the jurisdiction of Department of forest & wildlife, UT \nChandigarh. The Dhanas Lake is a picturesque water body that has \nplenty to offers its visitors. \n \n Fig.1: Map of Dhanas Lake \n \nElevation- 342 m\n \nPage 4  \n \n \n Hydrological description of water body and Catchment Description \n \nThe inflow of water is coming from forest area & Post \nGraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), UT \nChandigarh and the depth of water during monsoon period remains 7 m \nand Non-monsoon period 4 m. The impounded water is basically used for \nrecreation and Conservation of aquatic biodiversity. The discharge of \nwater flow destination is in the Patiala Ki Rao Reserved Forest. The total \npopulation living around the water body is 7,094 as per 2011 census and \nthe regular footfall of the people in this Lake is approx 1,000 persons per \nday. \n However, the use of Lake is to protect Bio-diversity but the major \npollution in the lake is improper disposal of Sewage Water, silting & \nWeeding.

The floating plant has a total of 34 photovoltaic of 300 \nwatts each. The plant has been set up on a platform that includes a large \nouter ring that floats on water, and grid supporting 34 panels which are \narranged on 7 rows in a hexagonal pattern. A propulsion system has also \nbeen fitted for keeping the panels in line with the direction of the sun. The \nbenefits of the Solar panels in this lake is to Improves water quality; \nReduces algae and removes phosphorus; Aeration breaks down \nunwanted bacteria; Decrease mosquito activity; Removes foul odor from \nLake or Pond; Enhances fish habitat & Improves efficiency of panels due \nto cooling effect of water. However, the Bio Remediation is also being \ndone from wastewater which further beautifies the lake and there are no \nindustrial estates surrounding of Dhanas Lake, UT Chandigarh  \n \nFig.2:- Photovoltaic Floating Solar Plant \n \nPage 7  \n \n \n \n        \n       Fig.3:- Working Solar Fountain \n \nFig.4:- Dhanas Reserved Forest \n \n \n \nPage 8  \n \n \n Adoption of Lake or Pond Restoration Techniques  \n \n1. \nBiological Method to clean lake:- The department will use biological \nmethod to clean the lake by using the rice straw, iron ores and \nSaccharum munja Grasses through methods of bio-remediation and \nwater health indicator such as BOD, DO, COD, PH etc. will regularly \nmeasured for better upkeep of the water body.  \n2. \nStone pitching at the bank of Choe:- It is needed on steep slopes of \nthe lake. This technique involves large interlocking of stones, with their \nflattest side up to create small irregular steps that blend into the \nlandscape. This method is particularly useful on slopes with a massive \nseepage problem, in flood-prone areas. \n3. \nSolar Plant:- The Department of Forests & Wildlife intends to install a \nSolar Plant of 01 MW with the help of CREST, which will help in \ngenerating the clean energy. Solar power is a great way to reduce the \ncarbon footprint and meaningfully contribute towards environment \nconservation. The process of aeration to bring the water and air into \nclose contact in order to remove dissolved gases, such as carbon \ndioxide, and to oxidize dissolved metals such as iron and it will also used \nto remove volatile organic chemicals (VOC) in the water. \n4. \nSeasonal Vegetation:- Planned for seasonal vegetation which helps to \nclean the atmosphere.  However, Seasonal Vegetation plays a critical \nregulatory role in carbon cycling and reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions. Seasonal vegetation at Dhanas Lake will include Flowering \nBeds, Native Green Grass/ Trees, Shrubs, etc.    \n \n \n \nPage 9  \n \n \n \n5. \nImprovement on Walk Track at the water body:-  The walk track will \nbe modified facilitating the general public/walkers.  \n6. \nInstallation of Entry gate, Exit gate and chain link fence:- The \nDepartment will install two gates one for entry and another for exit with \nsecurity guards. A Chain link fence around the lake will be installed, so \nthat the public will enter in the lake through a specific point only. \n7. \nInstallation of Drinking Water facility and Dustbin for Garbage:- \nThere is need for installation of Drinking Water facility at Dhanas Lake \nfor the visitor and bins to keep the lake neat and clean.  \n8.  \nWater Quality:- To reach BOD from average value of 8 mg/l to less than \n5mg/l by March, 2022. \n \n \n \nPage \n10 \n \n \n \n Restoration Form \n  \n \nThe Superintending Engineer, Construction Circle-II, UT. \nChandigarh, vide letter

INTRODUCTION\n\nSports is microcosm of life; and it will not be an exaggeration to state that the values of a\nnation could be judged through the quality of ethos, commitment and discipline perpetuated\nby her sportspersons. The astonishing charisma of Sports acts as glue to gel people of\ndifferent hues in a single thread of unbridled joy in seeing their athletes and players compete\nto best of their abilities and bringing laurels in form of Medals & Trophies.\n\nThis high power accrues to a sport from a bottomless well of unprecedented sacrifice,\nunheard toil, and unseen sweat & blood which a sportsperson sheds during his or her\nunending practice sessions against all odds. Only to make his or her country prouder! No\ndoubt the biggest charm of watching sports is that it is the purest form of duel between two\ncompetitors mandated to exhibit their skill- sets in most genuine, fair and on a rule-based\nregimen. The raw honesty and innate sincerity is the hallmark ofa sportsperson.\n\nSuccess in sports is always hard earned and the triumph of willpower not only feeds\nhumankind's pursuits to win bigger but also nurtures the soul. It teaches discipline, a vital\ningredient to succeed in life in general. An otherwise disciplined person might not be a\nsportsperson, but a sportsperson will always be disciplined. It also instils a sense of\ncooperation, teamwork and collaboration thereby leading to establish a society which is in\nsync with individual and collective aspirations of each other, in line with achievement of\ngreater national goals through citizen camaraderie.\n\nThat Sports bridges across not only national but global differences as well, has been evident\nmore than once with political leaders of eminence taking recourse to Sports Diplomacy, to\nrestore ties of peace & stability, when all other tactics and manoeuvres of governance do not\nyield desired results.\n\nUnrelenting nurturing of this immensely vibrant culture of inspiration through sports,\nrequires a well-researched, efficiently-funded and ably-supported framework in the form of\na Policy Document, known as Sports Policy.\n\nSports Policy is amongst the most vital cogs in nation's efforts to keep producing\nsportspersons of highest merit through equitable availability of resources, to all who aspire\nto be role models for their citizens. A well devised and executed Sports framework acts as a\nstrategic blueprint, automatically sculpting success stories by promoting sports at right\nlevels by seeking to increase participation and sustaining the competitive spirit through\ninnovation and inspiration by providing world class infrastructure, right from the start to all\nbudding sports lovers and citizenry in general. Hence, this Sports Policy!\n\n(Page 3-29) Sports Policy\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n2. BACKGROUND OF CHANDIGARH SPORTS DEPARTMENT\n\nInitially Sports Department was part of Education Department; and to provide it more\nautonomy it was bifurcated subsequently from Education Department in 1982. Since then, it\nhas been functioning as an independent Department and anchoring the role of being a\nproactive, responsible and caring institution in the service of sportspersons by creating and\nnurturing a sustainable sports ecosystem to ensure all round development of her citizens\n\nWith the purpose of ensuring efficacious disbursal and accountability of sports funds,\nChandigarh Sports Council (a registered society) was created by Chandigarh\nAdministration in 1987 which acts in liaison with the Sports Department. Conceptualized to\ncomplement & support the Sports Department, the role of Chandigarh Sports Council\n(CSC) involves further fortification of the sports development programmes by ensuring\ntimely and regular financial support to State Sports Associations/Federations, needy as well\nas commendable sportspersons.\n\nWith the creation of the Sports Authority of India in 1982 and its policies for financial\nassistance, the role of CSC was revised to involve granting recognition to Sports\nAssociations and to extend financial and other assistance as per rules framed from time to\ntime for the purpose; to look after the welfare of sportspersons and to provide necessary\nmonetary assistance to them, organising tournaments and operate schemes for\nsportspersons on behalf of the Directorate of Sports as may be entrusted to the CSC from\ntime to time, besides playing an advisory role regarding cash awards to meritorious sports\npersons & coaches, mobilizing/tapping probable financial resources viz. Sponsorships,\nCSR Funds etc. for sports development. Chandigarh Sports Council gets grant in aid per\nannum from Chandigarh Administration as per budgetary norms of Chandigarh\nAdministration.\n\nWith continuous thrust on creation of world class sports infrastructure with top-class\namenities, the Department has successfully created an array of facilities across a wide\nsports-spectrum. Diversity of disciplines on offer is contributing towards creation ofa larger\ntalent pool of budding sports enthusiasts accentuates Chandigarh’s representation across\ngreater sports competitions both at National and International levels. Vast legacy of\nsportspersons originating from the Union Territory of Chandigarh to rise and shine India’s\nhonour on national and international scene is the biggest achievement and motivation for the\nDepartment which actively engages with all stakeholders and is steadfastly endeavouring to\nbring all its existing infrastructure to evolving developments in the sports arena, besides\nensuring that all new facilities bear the hall-mark of top-in-class techniques & technology.\n\nSports Policy (Page 4-29)\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n3.

In this context, apart from athlete development, strategic coach development by\ntheir exposure to continuous academic & practical learning keeps them abreast with latest\nknowledge in tandem with global changing and innovative coaching trends. Hence Sports\nDepartment, Chandigarh Administration has planned to organise periodical\nrefresher/orientation coaching courses by respective International/National Federations,\nSports Authority of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, Government of India,\nInternational Olympic committee, not only to harness their coaching skills but also their\nexposure to physiological, psychological, sports medicine, nutrition, Long term Athlete\nDevelopment, Training methods etc.\n\nAt the same time, Sports department is concerned that Coaches need to be motivated also by\nawards (Honour and cash) after their appropriate performance appraisal & continuous\nevaluation. Continuous evaluation of coaches will also determine accountability of\ncoaches.\n\n21. SPORTS INJURY & REHABILITATION\n\nSport and injury go hand in hand; and every sportsperson is prone to getting injured which\nmay at worst even threaten his/her career. Government invests in each of the sportsperson\nand injury to a promising sportsperson is also a national loss in terms of loss of talent,\nexperience, training and prospective medals for the country. Quick and timely rehabilitation\ntherefore becomes paramount to mitigate the extent of injury, lessen the impairment and\ntake immediate protective action to ensure against any long-term loss to the sportsperson\nand the nation.\n\nSpecialized Rehabilitation ecosystem, though in a nascent stage in India; it is a fast\ndeveloping one. State of the art Sports Injury and Rehabilitation Centre will be set-up with\nbest of modern technologies and techniques in vogue to ensure our players do not lag behind\nin any respect while preparing for national and international level competitions. Feasibility\nfor investment through Public Private Partnership will be explored for long-term sustenance\nand nurturing of this crucial sporting aspect in the evolving international sporting\nlandscape. To begin with, Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) can be signed with\npremier government institutes.\n\nDomain experts, doctors, physiotherapists would be hired to oversee a science driven\n\nmultidisciplinary approach to ensure the return of the athlete to optimum mathletic function,\nincase ofan injury.\n\n(Page 25-29) Sports Policy\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n22. PSYCHOLOGICAL & MENTAL WELL-BEING\n\nPsychological and mental wellbeing of sportspersons is equally crucial at par with their\nphysical fitness. Culmination of a trainee into a productive, successful, and a world class\nsportsperson depends massively upon his mental and physiological toughness. Given the\never-rising competition level and stress which impacts the performance of athletes, it is\nnecessary to take care of our athletes’ overall wellbeing right through their careers.\n\nThe physical fitness and the skills go haywire if the psychological components of an athlete\nlike fighting spirit, mental toughness, strength management, positive attitude, self-\nconfidence, self-reliance and optimism etc. do not complement the physical, physiological,\ntechnical and tactical traits and components of any sports person pursuing sports for high\nperformance in a competitive environment. The psychological build-up of an athlete can\nalso be nurtured with systematic and pro-active training involving qualified sports\npsychologists and harnessing the support systems and physical & mental activities like\nyoga, meditation which also help in physiological and psychological fitness, focus and\nconcentration, conditioned body metabolism, mental relaxation and the ability to deliver the\nbest of an athlete without fear and apprehension of the outcome of a competition as all\npsychological and mental training train a person for optimum level of anxiety to perform\nmeticulously in competitive environment.\n\nTo achieve this end, a dedicated Wellbeing Centre will be set up for which Public Private\nPartnership model will be explored. Initially, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical\nEducation & Research Sector 12 Chandigarh can be taken on board through an\nMemorandum of Understanding (MoU) till the specialized Centre is established.\n\n23. PREVENTION OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE\n\nTo effectively negate and combat likelihood of substance abuse by sportspersons, a\nCommittee under supervision of Joint Director Sports with District Sports Officer, a Senior\nCoach of the Department and representative of Director Health Services, Chandigarh\nAdministration as Members would oversee regular conduct of surprise drug testing checks\nboth during the Championships/Tournaments and during the off time.\n\nDepartment would also hold across the year awareness programmes to spread awareness\nabout substance abuse and its harmful impact on sportspersons. Concerted efforts would be\nmade to harmonise anti-doping policies mandated by World Anti-doping Agency (WADA)\nand National Anti-doping Agency (NADA)into the rules and regulations of the Department\nto ensure stringent compliance.\n\nSports Policy (Page 26-29)\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n24. STAKEHOLDERS’ ENGAGEMENT\n\nStakeholders are individuals, groups or organizations that have vested interest or concern in\na particular project, business or organization. Stakeholders are important because they can\nprovide essential support, influence decision making, hold an organization accountable,\npromote innovation and creativity and contribute to long term success. Thus, identification\nand engagement of stakeholders is very important and critical for an organization.\n\nThis Sports Policy recognises the importance and relevance of various stakeholders in\npromoting sports in the City and envisages working with them in synergy.\n\nChandigarh Sports Department keeps a vision for team work with all its stakeholders viz.\nAthletes/Participants, Parents/Guardians, Coaches, Support Staff, Officials, Chandigarh\nSports Council, Education Department, Chandigarh, Educational Institutions in the City,\nPrivate Sports Academies, Corporates/PSUs, Media, Chandigarh Olympic Associations,\nChandigarh Sports Associations, NGO’s operating in sport sectors, National Sports\nFederations, Administrators, MYAS, GOI/SAI.\n\nThere is dire need of amalgamation of sports with education curriculum and Sports\nDepartment intends to engage with Education Department, U.T. Chandigarh for tapping\nmaximum resources so as to identify sports talent at grass root level and its structured\npathway from grass root to elite level as per Long Term Athlete Development (LTAD)\nprogram.\n\nIn any Sports Development initiative of various Govt. organizations, collaboration with\ncorporate sector has become need of the hour. Sports Department Chandigarh understands\nthe need for participation with Corporate Sector and Public Sector Undertakings by\nproviding policy & programs for sustainable sports development. The Corporates believes\nin and acknowledge their brand development through sports, in terms of 'marketing through\nsport! viz. getting associated with/ sponsorship of various sports events, endorsements etc.\nAt the same time, Sports organizations in the Govt. look beyond their limited financial\nresources. Hence, a PPP (Public Private Partnership) model of Govt. and corporates is a win-\nwin situation for both the sides. Apart from that, the corporate sectors have CSR (Corporate\nSocial Responsibility) initiatives for sports development for social cause and they have\nhuge fund spared for this space in leveraging their potential for sponsorship, endorsements\nunder CSR ambit, for their image/brand development through sports.\n\nTo ensure extreme realization of overall vision of Sports Policy, the role of varied\nstakeholders is critical as harnessing core competence/experience/expertise of each and the\nseamless coherence with them is must in strengthening the Department’s endeavour to\ncreate a cohesive sports ecosystem.\n\n25. WALL OF FAME\n\nTo honour & acknowledge elite sports persons of Chandigarh and to inspire budding\nathletes, a Wall- of- Fame would be created in every sports complex of sports department\nand Government & Private educational institutions, which will be instrumental to generate\nhero worship so that potential athletes emulate the sport legends of yester years.\n\n(Page 27-29) Sports Policy\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n26. DATA BANK OF SPORTSPERSONS\n\nTo further streamline and strengthen department’s player outreach mechanism, an online\ndatabank would be generated with all the required information about our sportspersons.\n\nData-driven evaluation of past performances would be employed to ensure designing of best\nsuited training modules for each and every sportsperson, Sports Department would be\ncollaborating and associating with nodal IT agencies of Chandigarh Administration viz.\nNIC and SPIC for maintenance & up-dation of sports data of sportspersons of for their\ntraining, development, scouting, safeguarding, periodical assessment, monitoring &\nevaluation.\n\n27. INSURANCE FOR ACTIVE SPORTSPERSONS\n\nInjuries are regular feature of a sportsperson’s life and a serious injury may impact not only\nthe sporting performance of the athlete but may also impair him for future life. Under this\npolicy, Department would explore feasibility of tying-up with government and private\ninsurance companies to provide insurance to active sportspersons from all kinds of sports\ninjuries picked up by the athlete while playing or practice. The list of sports covered under\nthis policy for insurance would be issued separately.\n\n28. SPORTS LIBRARY\n\nFeats of past are harbinger of future laurels. Chandigarh is blessed to have an amazing\nrepository of sporting excellence owing to galaxy of stars who have left an indelible mark on\nthe collective sporting psyche of the nation with their commitment, dedication and\nendurance. Stories of stars including Late Sardar Milkha Singh have become part of folklore\nand it is obligatory to transfer that passion to younger generations for harnessing their talent\nwith inspiration.\n\nWith this avowed purpose and to inspire budding sportspersons, a centralized state-of-the-\nart Sports Library would be set up showcasing the vast legacy of past and present sports\nachievements, chronological sports record of eminent sportspersons, highlights of their\nmajor achievements and their message for the youth. Sufficient space for recreational sports\nwould be created to give uninitiated the feel & touch of taking up a sport for the nation!\n\n“Reading is to the mind, what exercise is to the body.” In a sports environment of\nrecreational as well as competitive, a sports person has to be mentally sound in terms of\ncritical and analytical thinking to strategize, organize and plan his optimum transfer of his\npotential and capability on and off the sports field. A well-equipped and tech-savvy library\ncomprising best of the books and journals (digital/ manual) for the players, coaches, officials\nand sports administrators will facilitate all concerned to keep themselves informed &\napprised with the latest attributes of competitive and recreational sport environment.\nChandigarh Sports Dept. will provide the world class library to easy access to all its\nstakeholders.\n\nSports Policy (Page 28-29)\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n29.
