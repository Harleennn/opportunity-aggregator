The call of the Honourable Prime Minister of India, articulated in his speech on the \neve of Independence Day, 2019, to transform every district into an export hub, has \nbecome the guiding light for economic policy across the country. Central to this \nvision is the idea that every region in India has traditional products and technologies \nwhich can be harnessed and promoted to create export hubs.  \n \n1.2. The Indian economy has grown tremendously over the last decade to occupy the \nposition of the fifth largest economy in the world, with a share of close to 8 percent \nin the global Gross Domestic Product. However, its  \nshare in the world exports is disproportionately low at less than 2 percent. This can \nbe explained to some extent by the size and diversity of the domestic market which \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nhas the capacity to consume most of the domestic production. This means that \nbusinesses are not incentivized to diversify in the export market in the natural \ncourse of growth. Rather export is seen as a specialized activity pursued by few big \nbusiness houses.   \n \n1.3. Another factor is the predominance of the MSME sector in India. These MSMEs \noften lack either the knowledge or the risk appetite to venture into the international \nmarket. However, the importance of trade as a pillar of economic growth cannot be \noverstated. As the trends of economic globalization only appear to intensify, it is \nimperative that the local economies are seamlessly integrated into the global \nmarketplace, thereby increasing the scope and sustainability of growth.   \n \n1.4. Planning for export growth in India has historically been a centralized process. This \nnew approach not only decentralizes the planning process, but also puts at its centre \nthe most valuable stakeholders, i.e. the local producers and manufacturers. Exports \nare emphasized not just to reduce trade deficit but as a mechanism for creating \nboosting rural economic growth too, making local products more attractive for \nconsumers across the world and supporting employment generation through \nempowering of the MSME sector. For this purpose, the district is the ideal \nadministrative level to integrate the rural economy with the industrial economy and \nto create a green channel for the MSME sector to access international markets.   \n \n1.5. However, as the global socio-economic and geo-political environment undergoes \nrapid changes after Corona pandemic, a proactive plan of action is necessary to \nensure that the district is enabled to participate in and benefit from the fourth \nindustrial revolution, i.e. Industry 4.0. This revolution is predicted to bring about \ntransformations not only in lifestyles and consumer choices but will also change the \nvery nature of production.  \n \n1.6. Chandigarh with its export performance, particularly in relation products of export \nexcellence can aspire to be a leader in the new era. Further, in view of its existing \ninfrastructural and institutional backbone, it is recognized that rather than massive \nmacroeconomic \nor \nstructural \nmeasures, \nthis \ninitiative \nrequires \ntargeted \ninterventions in specific processes and sectors  \n \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \n1.7. Therefore, the District Export Plan for the district aims to realize the vision of \ncreating export centric economic development through limited but sustainable \ninterventions, targeted specifically at the district level.   \n \n2. \nPOLICY VISION  \n2.1. This initiative is intended as the next step in competitive and cooperative federalism, \ntaking trade planning to the district level so that an inclusive, participative, ground \nroot approach can be adopted. This vision then is :  \n“ to transform every district into an export powerhouse, competitive with and \nintegrated into the technologically advanced global market, through a participative \napproach which emphasizes and values the ‘local’, connects the rural and urban \neconomies seamlessly and produces sustainable and equitable economic \ndevelopment”.   \n \n3. \nMISSION  \n3.1. The mission of this plan is to synergize the efforts of the centre and the state \ngovernment and to create institutional mechanisms to promote trade. This \ninstitutional structure will be set up at the district and will act as both the creator \nand the implementer of sustainable district level export promotion strategies.  \n3.2. The institutional mechanisms will focus on translating the demands of modernization \ninto scalable solutions for MSMEs as well as industry leaders to enter and succeed in \nthe field of export. These solutions will aim to increase the competitiveness of \ndomestic industry, boost exports through both an increase in volume and through \nvalue addition, create sustainable employment- generating economic growth and \nlead to rapid socio-economic development.  \n \n4. \nOBJECTIVES  \n4.1. The objectives of this District Export Plan are:  \n To enhance the volume of exports from each district.  \n To create a flexible and permanent institutional mechanism with participation from \nall stakeholders to act as a facilitator and guidance system for export incentivization.  \n To identify lead products and sectors for targeted and continued interventions for \nexport promotion  \n To synergize various schemes at the center, state and district level which address \nindustry, agriculture and exports  \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \n To provide support both domestically and internationally to local industry from the \nproduction stage to the exporting stage.   \n To increase efficiency in the supply chains and augment export infrastructure  \n To augment both supply and demand through product and market diversification.    \n \n5. \nSTRATEGY  \n5.1. The choice of strategy is determined by the opportunities offered by decentralised \nlocal level planning as well the constraints presented by the lack of official district \nlevel data on exports  \n5.2. Therefore, the approach adopted includes broad-based consultations with district \nadministration, district industries centre, local industry including exporters, Export \nPromotion councils, industry associations, lead banks, inspection and control \nauthorities etc. The information gathered from these consultations is intended to \naugment the limited official data through qualitative first hand testimony regarding \nthe condition of export in the district.  \n5.3. An assessment of the current situation will help in the creation of an economic \nprofile and an export profile of the district. This is used to identify the lead export \nproducts and sectors in the district as well as the major challenges and opportunities \nfor the export community and the MSMEs. Based on the product and the problems \nindicated by the industry, specific solutions are designed for implementation at the \ndistrict level as well as to be recommended to the state and central government.  \n5.4. This exercise is not intended to be a one-time activity. The District Export Promotion \nCommittee, which have been set up in the district, will seek to set up a mechanism \nto provide continuous facilitation to the industry in dealings with the complexities \nand concerns in the export procedures. These committees will be composed in a \nmanner which can best serve all the needs of the industry and trade in the district.   \n5.5. The strategy for export promotion will not be limited to measures related to export \nonly but will comprehensively address all aspects having direct and indirect impact \nfrom farm to fork and factory to consumer. A study of the entire value chain, \nparticularly in the lead sectors and products is critical for this purpose. From such a \nstudy agenda points will be formulated to improve infrastructure, financing facilities, \nmarketing and so on.   \n5.6. A policy with all good intentions may not yield any results without effective \nimplementation. Mechanisms for implementing, reviewing and reporting on the \npolicy will be also be outlined within this document. Such reviewing is intended to \nenable course correction based on the feedback received from the various \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nstakeholders. Expected outcomes and timelines will be clearly outlined along with \nnodal agencies responsible for specific measures against which the efficacy of the \npolicy can be assessed.  \n5.7. In addition to the lead sectors, certain sunrise sectors, both in goods and services \nwill be identified to create a favourable ecosystem so that the economies of the \ndistrict as well as the state continue to be competitive, sustainable and dynamic.   \n5.8. The policy will also consider the best way to technology to benefit exporters in the \ndistrict. Digitization of processes to facilitate faster and simpler procedures will be \nencouraged.  \n \n6. \nWhy there is single export plan for District and State/UT for Chandigarh? \n \nChandigarh is a City State. Administratively, it is Union Territory under control of \nMinistry of Home of Central Government. Chandigarh has only one district. So \ndistrict export product will be same as state/UT product. Same, the district has same \nstrength, weakness, opportunities and threat as state/UT. So District Export Plan is \nsame as State Export Plan. \n \n7.  \nTo execute the vision of Honourable Prime Minister, Chandigarh Administration \nconstituted State Export Promotion Committee. Since Chandigarh is single district \nUnion Territory, separate District Export Promotion Committee has not formed. \nNotification of the constitution of the committee was published on 07.10.20 by the \nAdministration: \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \n \n \n \n \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \n8.  \nThe meeting was convened by Respected Chairman Sir and Advisor to \nAdministrator of UT of Chandigarh on 14-12-2020 at 11:00 AM in Chandigarh. \nMembers present in the meeting were as under. \n \n1. Principal Secretary Home, U.T. Chandigarh \n2. Deputy Commissioner, U.T. Chandigarh \n3. Secretary Information Technology, U.T. Chandigarh \n4. Secretary Industries, U.T. Chandigarh \n5. Joint Director General Foreign Trade , Ludhiana, Punjab \n6. Deputy Director General Foreign Trade, Ludhiana, Punjab \n7. Director Industries, U.T. Chandigarh \n8. Joint Secretary Industries, U.T.

In the meeting, detailed discussion was done and the products for export \npotential were zeroed out as follows: \nSr No\nProducts\n1\nNeedles\n2\nInformation Technology\nand Information \nTechnology Enabled \nServices \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nCHAPTER - 2 \nECONOMIC PROFILE \n \n \nChandigarh has been rated as the “Wealthiest Town” of India. In 2015-16, \nChandigarh’s gross state domestic product recorded Rs 26379.19 crore with a per \ncapita income of Rs 2338.58 crore. Chandigarh's gross state domestic product for \n2014-15 is estimated at 0.29 lakh crore (US$4.3 billion) in current prices. According \nto Thelon’s 2016 survey, Chandigarh is ranked 22nd among the globally identified \n\"Top 100 outsourcing destinations\".   \n \n1.1 ADVANTAGE CHANDIGARH  \n \n• \nChandigarh is the centre point to Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh  \n• \nBeing centre point, creation of common infrastructure will prove beneficial to \nexporters of these three locations.  \n• \nIt is a tax free UT. There is no entry tax. There is an enormous scope for setting \nup of hi-tech and knowledge based economic activities.  \n \n1.2 INDUSTRIAL SCENARIO - CHANDIGARH  \n \nThere are about 2950 Small Scale and 15 Large and Medium Scale Units in existence \nin Chandigarh. Growth of industry for the last few years has been limited in \nChandigarh as it is not an industry led city because of the limited space envisaged for \nindustrial development at the time of original planning of the city. However, still \nkeeping in view the fact that industry would provide crucial resource base in the city, \na limited area of about 1450 acres was planned for development as industrial area \nmainly for the development of small scale and pollution free industries.   \n \nOut of a total of about 2950 small scale industries in Chandigarh about 40% are \nancillary units producing components for the major tractor industry around \nChandigarh. Light engineering industry is heavily represented, other industrial units \nproduce mainly industrial fasteners, electrical / electronic items, machine tools, \npharmaceuticals, plastic goods, sanitary fittings, steel / wooden furniture and food \nproducts etc. A number of items manufactured here are finding ready markets \n1. PROFILE OF CHANDIGARH\nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nabroad. The total estimated annual output of industries is to be tune of Rs. 650.00 \ncrore.   \n \n1.3 PRESENCE OF Information Technology related industry \n \nWith the establishment of Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Technology Park (RGCTP), \nChandigarh has not only come up on the national map but also on the international \nscene. Companies like Infosys, Virsa, Net-Solutions, Taurus agile, and IBM are a few \ninternational IT companies which have established their units. The Phase I of RGCTP \nhas already been accorded Special Economic Zone (SEZ) status by Ministry of \nCommerce, Government of India. Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Technology Park (RGCTP) \nprovides world class integrated infrastructure necessary for the setting up of \nfacilities/campuses by leading Technology Companies and other IT/ITES/BPO \ncompanies for the first time in this region. Coupled with proactive IT & ITES Policies \nthe city is emerging as the hub for IT & IT Enabled Services.  \n \nThe Chandigarh Administration is focusing on promotion of IT industry which \nrequires lesser space and is also non-polluting. With the help of Punjab Govt.

The earliest needles were made of bone or \nwood; modern needles are manufactured from high carbon steel wire and are nickel- \nor 18K gold-plated for corrosion resistance. High quality embroidery needles are \nplated with two-thirds platinum and one-third titanium alloy. Traditionally, needles \nhave been kept in needle books or needle cases which have become objects of \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nadornment. Sewing needles may also be kept in an étui, a small box that held \nneedles and other items such as scissors, pencils and tweezers. A sewing needle, \nused for hand-sewing, is a long slender tool with a pointed tip at one end and a hole \n(or eye) at the other. The earliest needles were made of bone or wood; modern \nneedles are manufactured from high carbon steel wire and are nickel- or 18K gold-\nplated for corrosion resistance. High quality embroidery needles are plated with \ntwo-thirds platinum and one-third titanium alloy. Traditionally, needles have been \nkept in needle books or needle cases which have become objects of adornment. \nSewing needles may also be kept in an étui, a small box that held needles and other \nitems such as scissors, pencils and tweezers. \nHand sewing needles come in a variety of types/ classes designed according to their \nintended use and in a variety of sizes within each type. \n Sharp Needles: used for general hand sewing; built with a sharp point, a round eye, \nand are of medium length. Those with a double-eyes are able to carry two strands of \nthread while minimizing fabric friction. \n Appliqué: These are considered another all-purpose needle for sewing, appliqué, and \npatch work. \n Embroidery: Also known as crewel needles; identical to sharps but have a longer eye \nto enable easier threading of multiple embroidery threads and thicker yarns. \n Betweens or Quilting: These needles are shorter than sharps, with a small rounded \neye and are used for making fine stitches on heavy fabrics such as in tailoring, quilt \nmaking and other detailed handwork; note that some manufacturers also distinguish \nbetween quilting needles and quilting between needles, the latter being slightly \nshorter and narrower than the former. \n Milliners: A class of needles generally longer than sharps, useful for basting and \npleating, normally used in millinery work. \n Easy- or Self-threading: Also called calyx-eyed sharps, side threading, and spiral eye \nneedles, these needles have an open slot into which a thread may easily be guided \nrather than the usual closed eye design. \n Beading: These needles are very fine, with a narrow eye to enable them to fit \nthrough the centre of beads and sequins along with a long shaft to thread and hold a \nnumber of beads at a time. \n Bodkin: Also called ballpoints, this is a long, thick needle with a ballpoint end and a \nlarge, elongated eye. They can be flat or round and are generally used for threading \nelastic, ribbon or tape through casings and lace openings. \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \n Chenille: These are similar to tapestry needles but with large, long eyes and a very \nsharp point to penetrate closely woven fabrics. Useful for ribbon embroidery. \n Darning: Sometimes called finishing needles, these are designed with a blunt tip and \nlarge eye making them similar to tapestry needles but longer; yarn darners are the \nheaviest sub-variety. \n Doll: Not designed for hand sewing at all, these needles are made long and thin and \nare used for soft sculpturing on dolls, particularly facial details. \n Leather: Also known as Glovers and as wedge needles, these have a triangular point \ndesigned to pierce leather without tearing it; often used on leather-like materials \nsuch as vinyl and plastic. \n Sailmaker: Similar to leather needles, but the triangular point extends further up the \nshaft; designed for sewing thick canvas or heavy leather. \n Tapestry: The large eye on these needles lets them to carry a heavier weight yarn \nthan other needles, and their blunt tip—usually bent at a slight angle from the rest \nof the needle—allows them to pass through loosely woven fabric such as embroidery \ncanvas or even-weave material without catching or tearing it; comes in a double-\neyed version for use on a mounted frame and with two colours of thread. \n Tatting: These are built along with an even thickness for their entire length, including \nat the eye, to enable thread to be pulled through the double stitches used in tatting. \n Upholstery: These needles are heavy, long needles that may be straight or curved \nand are used for sewing heavy fabrics, upholstery work, tufting and for tying quilts; \nthe curved variety is practical for difficult situations on furniture where a straight \nneedle will not work Heavy duty 12\" needles are used for repairing mattresses. \nStraight sizes: 3\"-12\" long, curved: 1.5\"-6\" long. \nUniversal (Style 2020) needles are used for all woven fabrics. This needle will \npenetrate the fabric threads of woven fabrics. Ball Point (Style 2045) needles are \nused for sewing on knits; the rounded tip allows the needle to pass between the \nfabric threads by separating them. \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \n \nSewing machine needle \nA sewing machine needle is a specialized needle for use in a sewing machine. A \nsewing machine needle consists of: \n shank - clamped by the sewing machine's needle holder \n shoulder - where the thick shank tapers down to the shaft \n shaft - a length suitable for driving the eye and thread through the material and \ndown to the bobbin \n groove - cut in the front of the shaft to allow the thread to lie more closely to the \nneedle as it passes through the fabric \n scarf - provides extra room for the hook or shuttle to pass close by \n eye - carries the thread \n point - penetrates the material by either parting the threads or cutting a hole in the \nfabric. \n \nEXPORT DATA \nTable: Export from India \nHS CODE 84523090: NEEDLES FR OTHER TYPE SEWNG MCHNS    \nValues in Rs.

IT workers help ensure that computers work \nwell for people. Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, \nretrieve, transmit, and manipulate data or information. IT is typically used within the \ncontext of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \ntechnologies. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications \ntechnology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an \ninformation system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a \ncomputer system – including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment – \noperated by a limited group of users.  \nHumans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating \ninformation since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 \nBC. However, the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in \na 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt \nand Thomas L. Whisler commented that \"the new technology does not yet have a \nsingle established name. We shall call it information technology (IT).\" Their definition \nconsists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical \nand mathematical methods to decision making, and the simulation of higher-order \nthinking through computer programs.  \nIT software and hardware \nIT includes several layers of physical equipment (hardware), virtualization and \nmanagement or automation tools, operating systems and applications (software) \nused to perform essential functions. User devices, peripherals and software, such as \nlaptops, smartphones or even recording equipment, can be included in the IT \ndomain. IT can also refer to the architectures, methodologies and regulations \ngoverning the use and storage of data.  \nBusiness applications include databases like SQL Server, transactional systems such \nas real-time order entry, email servers like Exchange, Web servers like Apache, \ncustomer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems. \nThese applications execute programmed instructions to manipulate, consolidate, \ndisperse or otherwise affect data for a business purpose.  \nComputer servers run business applications. Servers interact with client users and \nother servers across one or more business networks. Storage is any kind of \ntechnology that holds information as data. Information can take any form including \nfile data, multimedia, telephony data and Web data, data from sensors or future \nformats. Storage includes volatile random access memory (RAM) as well as non-\nvolatile tape, hard disk and solid-state flash drives.  \nIT architectures have evolved to include virtualization and cloud computing, where \nphysical resources are abstracted and pooled in different configurations to meet \napplication requirements. Clouds may be distributed across locations and shared \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nwith other IT users, or contained within a corporate data center, or some \ncombination of both deployments.  \nIT education and job functions \nA team of administrators and other technical staffers deploy and manage the \ncompany's IT infrastructure and assets. IT teams depend on a wide range of \nspecialized information and technology skills and knowledge to support equipment, \napplications and activities. Third-party contractors and IT vendor support personnel \naugment the IT team.  \nThe information technology profession is extremely diverse. IT workers can specialize \nin fields like software development, application management, hardware components \nsuch as desktop support, server or storage administrator and network architecture. \nMany businesses seek IT professionals with mixed or overlapping skill sets.  \n \nCommon IT careers: \nChief information officer: This person is responsible for IT and computer systems \nthat support the enterprise's goals.  \nChief technology officer: This person sets all technology goals and policies within an \norganization.  \nList of Top IT Companies in Chandigarh \n Infosys. Infosys is considered as the best IT company in Chandigarh region situated at \nIT park in Chandigarh with vast premises and with an excellent reputation among all \nIT companies. ... \n Tech Mahindra \n Net Gains Pvt ltd \n IDS Infotech \n Net Solutions \n Netsmartz \n Kays Harbor Technologies \n FCS Software Solutions \n Winshuttle \n A-1 Technology \n IndiWork Software Solutions Private Limited \nChandigarh City as IT hub can do better; lacks marketing \nEven the city as preferred information technology (IT) destination ranks high among \nthe tier-2 cities in the country, it lacks aggressive marketing. Metros fall in the \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \ncategory of tier-1, while mid-segment cities are regarded as tier-2 and smaller cities \nas tier-3. \nElaborating upon various aspects of key findings of location assessment report of \nChandigarh, experts opined that the complexion of IT sector would have been \ndifferent had it been aggressively marketed outside by the decision makers. The \nstudy has been conducted by Cushman and Wakefield, a commercial real estate \nservices firm, in association with National Association of Software and Services \nCompanies (NASSCOM). \nFor the study, Chandigarh was randomly picked among four other cities - \nAhmedabad, Kochi, Trivandrum and Vadodara - falling in the same category. The \nstudy was based on seven parameters - talent pool, social infrastructure, business \nenvironment, government support, physical infrastructure, operational efficiency \nand real estate cost - in last five year. \nAccording to the study, there has been an improvement in social infrastructure and \noperational efficiency while the other segments have remained stagnant. \nChandigarh has been rated second in terms of software export while it secured third \nplace for employee head count. The student enrolment is also amongst the highest. \nThe other factors going in favour of city include high English proficiency, close \nproximity to established IT hubs like Gurgaon and Noida, low workforce cost and \nreasonable environment. \nPriyankar Bhikshu, director investor services Cushman and Wakefield, said that the \neffort to promote Chandigarh as IT destination is missing from the administrative set \nup. \"How will others come to know what all we have to offer unless it is not \nmarketed? Decision makers should aggressively make efforts to bring in big IT \ncompanies for the growth,\" said Bhikshu, who gave example of Haryana where the \ngovernment made desperate efforts for promoting Gurgaon as an IT destination. \nChandigarh is the first planned city in the country and still maintains its status as one \nof the best managed cities in the country. The excellent social infrastructure, large \ngreen spaces and its compact size make Chandigarh an ideal work environment. The \nquality of life in the City Beautiful is comparable to the best cities across the world. \nSCENARIO OF IT & ITES IN CHANDIGARH \nThe Industrial Policy of the administration has put focus on IT and IT-enabled \nindustry. After the quashing of acquisition of land for Phase III of the Rajiv Gandhi \nChandigarh Technology Park, the administration had decided that the expansion of \nthe IT industry would be done in the Industrial Area. While allowing IT services, the \nadministration mentioned in its policy that the existing units can set up IT-based \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nindustry, including software and electronics hardware units, but any activity entailing \ndirect customer interface will not be allowed. Under IT hardware units, activities \nsuch as manufacturing of computer devices, printer, scanners and related devices, \nnetworking products and telecommunication units are allowed. Under software \nunits, entrepreneurs can opt for telecommunication and mobile communication \nsoftware and application software operating system. Permission is granted for \nopening outsourcing units including call centres, audio visual or gaming production \nstudios as well as web designing and web content development services. \nRAJIV GANDHI SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY PARK, CHANDIGARH \nRGCTP is a premier initiative of Chandigarh Administration. It is an ISO 9001:2008 \ncertified Technology Park, which has changed the economic scenario of the city and \nthe vicinity by facilitating the growth of the economy, especially in the Services \nsector. RGCTP has been planned to retain this upgraded human capital by providing \nthem employment opportunities here itself. \nISSUES RELATED TO RAJIV GANDHI SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY PARK \n Ecosystem development is very crucial for boosting IT exports from \nChandigarh. There is no land available to set up IT companies in STP. Nearly \n90% of the companies are below 10 crores. A 5 acres land has been provided \nwhich is very big for setting up IT industries and 2 acres of land is apt for \nsetting up small IT companies. Through this, 200-300 companies can be \nestablished.  \n The Entrepreneur Development Centre (EDC) is conceived by the Chandigarh \nAdministration in the prospering Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Technology Park \n(RGCTP) to enhance the export of the software export from Chandigarh and to \nassist young professionals in setting up their entrepreneurship by providing \nshell space or space with plug and play facilities in a state of the art \nenvironment friendly and an intelligent building. The centre is available for \nyoung professionals but they charge Rs 55/sq ft, so entrepreneurs cannot \nsurvive. It should be made free for one year.  \n Many companies have given their space on lease to some non-IT companies \nwhich is a cause of concern.  \n Skilled manpower is not available in Chandigarh. Not many multi-national \ncompanies have set up their facilities in Chandigarh and therefore a large \nnumber of professionals shift to bigger cities for greener pasture. \n Absence of Development centres in Chandigarh is another reason for \nmovement of skilled professionals from Chandigarh as they are in Pune or \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nHyderabad. There are less government run engineering colleges in Chandigarh \nas a result of which skilled professional have to be outsourced. \n Too much regulation in Chandigarh (as it is affected by Mohali as well as \nPanchkula regions) is also limiting the multinational IT companies to get \nestablished in STP. Due to this reason, Dell shifted to Gurgaon and Emerson \nmoved to Noida. \n Limited connectivity by air (only Dubai currently) also limits the scope of \nexports of IT services and needs attention \n There is no venture capital funded company in Chandigarh (only 2), but they \nare 700 in Bangalore. There is no private equity player in IT Company focusing \n/ based in Chandigarh. Venture Capital and Private Equity are very important \nfor growth of IT industry. \n 90% of the companies are MSMEs and are self-funded and do not get Banks \nsupport in view of requirement of collateral. \nINCUBATION CENTRE \nAt present 5 start up companies are operating from SPIC (Society For Promotion Of \nIT In Chandigarh) IT incubation centre which are Hoolime, CENTELLI India LLP, \nVerifavia, Himfox Studio, VolumeTree. All 5 companies have started their venture \nfrom SPIC incubation. \n Hoolime a start up company has taken up space at SPIC IT incubation Centre \nwhich will majorly work on healthcare products for the offshore markets. The \ncompany has been formed by three partners who are having more than 10 \nyears for working experience in IT Industry. They will provide patient \nengagement solutions developing deeper partnership between patients and \nproviders along the whole continuum of care, through A.

Various modes of providing these services are present and can \nbe chosen as per the buyer requirement.

Through various \nmeetings following are observed by the authorities about problems and issues face by the \nexporters of the region. \n \nIssues/problems being faced by the Industries:- \n Economic Unions:- The negative aspect of international marketing is the \nincreasing tendency among nations to form small groups of economic unions. As a \nGreat educational and \nfinancial hub and \nknown as pensioners’ \nparadise \nMost employment \nopportunities are \nbecause of forest and \nagricultural sources, \nthat vary as per the \nclimatic conditions \nUntapped \nopportunities:   IT \nindustry \nAgriculture Industry \nHealth tech \nEnergy and \ncleantech \nService Industry \nHospitality Industry \nCompetitors from \nneighbouring stats\nCity has been rated as\none of the wealthiest \ntowns of India \nIncreasing vehicular \ntraffic that would \nincrease pollution in \nthe times to come \nMultiple employment \nopportunities \nJob and \nemployment \nsaturation \nGreat tourist \ndestination with \nnumerous places and \nneighbouring tourist \nstations. \nNon availability of \nnatural resources and \nraw material  \nDeveloping suburbs \non the peripheral \nlocation. \n \nWell connected by \nroad, rail and air \n \n \n \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nresult, apart from assuring a free flow of trade among themselves, the member \ncountries as a group, are in a better position to negotiate terms for their trade with \nother countries. ASEAN, COMECON, are a few examples of this. \n Different Trade Patterns:- Different procedures/documentations/policies exist in \ndifferent countries and Indian exporters have to primarily deal with the trade patterns \nof various countries. It has to take into account those trade policies of various \ncountries which govern their imports and exports.  \n Different Languages:- An Indian may be expert only in English and Hindi or Local \nLanguages, a very few people have command over different languages spoken \nacross the world. It becomes very difficult to communicate and understand the \nlanguage of foreign traders. \n Restrictive Trade Barriers:- The government of India has imposed various trade \nrestrictions. Traders/Businessmen have to pay export duty, so many small exporters \nfind it difficult to export their products. \n Lack of information about foreign traders:- There is no knowledge portal  for \nsmall exporters from where they can access online information regarding \ncreditworthiness of the buyer of the other countries. The  exporters don’t have \nnecessary capacity   to navigate complex export deals  in international markets, \nhence they avoid taking risk while dealing with the foreign traders.  \n \nLopsided Development:- As a developing country there is scarcity of high end \nmanufacturing technology and infrastructure, the Indian exporters are not able to \ncompete with the products manufactured by the other countries. Therefore Indian \nexporters prefer to export raw material. \n \n  Issues related to Advance Authorizations are as under: \no In case of reduced Norms, the interest on Duty Difference is calculated from the \ndate of import of material. It should be calculated from the date of fixation of Norms. \nThis is because the import has been made in good faith and as per application. \no No credit is available for the GST paid on Duty Difference. This is because the \nrespective column of GST is not specified in payment Challan (Form TR6 / GAR7) \nand, consequently, is not captured in the GST Portal. \n Testing Lab Requirements for defence component manufacturing. \n  \n Difficulties in payments:- In foreign trade, exchange of currencies takes place. \nThere is a big time gap between the delivery of goods and receipt of payment. So it \nbecomes difficult for the Indian exporters with small working capital to wait for their \npayments. \n  GST refund delay:- Delay in getting the GST refund is another major issue which \nthe exporters have to face. This leads to shrinkage of their working capital for a \nlonger period. \n Transport and logistics bottlenecks:-  Transport and logistics cost is very high for \nthe exporters in case of hinterland locations. Inland Container Depots, Dedicated \nfreight bogies and Corridors may help in reducing the costs involved and enhance \ntheir competitiveness globally. \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \n Risk factors involved:- The quantum of risk is higher in foreign trade than that in \ninternal business. In foreign trade, goods are transported to quite long distances and \nusually through seaways. There are chances of goods getting damaged during \ntransportation/loading and unloading. \n Insufficient  Export Publicity or Promotion:- Poor trade supports, gaps in export  \npreparedness, lack of access to financial facility and low export credit are some of \nthe major drawbacks which obstruct trade preparedness. Promoting export trade in \nIndia is one of the major issues that Indian government should work on in order to \nhave a considerable growth in terms of export trade.  \n \n \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \n \n Recommendations \n \n1. First and foremost, the Administration needs to identify thrust areas/sectors for \nexports. Apart from this, export promotion policy needs to focus on incentives like \nmarket support, financial and non-financial incentives to MSMEs, and stressing on \nproduct and process standards and quality certifications by upgrading existing labs at \npar with national ones. \n2. Accessibility of information to exporters from an official source is a primary pre-\nrequisite for growth. Moreover, an online trade portal can be utilized to match \ninterested buyers and exporters. Thus, an online portal sharing relevant information \nmust be created. \n3. GST credit of exporters is delayed by years. Mechanism needs to be developed to \nallow timely credit of GST. Export Documentation process is lengthy and mostly \noffline, which takes a lot of time to move the file from one desk to another. Procedure \nneeds to be simplified and less time consuming. \n4. Information technology and services parks have been set up in the region and they \ncan be converted to SEZ as multi-storeys can be constructed with no limit in the SEZ \npremises. Skill development or training institute, or calibration lab, if needed, can be \nset up as per the requirement of the industry.  \n5. Building a trade guide is another alternative to disseminate relevant information \nespecially while targeting potential exporters, Agri-exporters and MSMEs. They \nshould be able to obtain market intelligence to compete better globally as they are \nusually unable to gather such crucial data by themselves due to their fragmented \nnature and lack of knowledge resources available to them. \n6. The Administration should ensure trade support to the exporters by organizing \ncapacity building/orientation workshops, perhaps in partnership with institutes of \nforeign trade and management, to help exporters actively benefit from potential \nexport market opportunities. \n7. The presence of Grievance Redressal machinery/office can help exporters by \neliminating any existing information asymmetry. A dedicated website can be created, \nwhere links of various departments can be placed along with simplified export related \nFAQs, procedures and flowcharts could also be placed. Inter departmental \ncoordination along with live interactions can be planned. Specific mobile application \nto resolve exporters’ issues and problems can be another possibility. \n \n8. There is an urgent need to enhance the production of power supply to be made \navailable to the export industry in the city along with issues related to the quality of \npower supply about fluctuations, line disruptions, untimely repair & maintenance of \nlines, lower voltage, etc. Also, make sure that prices are kept low and competitive. \n9. Pushing for international connectivity from the city airport and offer a concession on \nair cargo facilities. Exporters from the city often depend on Delhi Int’l Airport for \nglobal consignments as flights from Chandigarh airport have limited air transport \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nconnectivity. An air customs station at the city airport should be set-up to cater to the \nspecialized needs of air-borne cargo on similar lines of a dry port. \n10. The Administration needs to encourage more exporters to be a part of state export \ncouncils by undertaking active membership drives, organizing investor summits, and \nsigning MoUs with private institutions. \n11. There is an urgent need to set-up a dry port at the outskirts of the city and look into   \n the feasibility of establishing a Multi-Modal Logistics Hub as well. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nCHAPTER - 8 \nACTION PLAN \n \n Keeping in view the economic /industrial profile of Chandigarh as well as issues and \nproblems being faced by the exporters the following action plan is suggested for   \nimplementation of Export Plan in respect of Union Territory of Chandigarh:-    \n \n1. The Administration shall identify thrust areas/sectors having potential for export. \nFocus needs to be laid on export promotion policy and various incentives like market \nsupport, financial and non-financial incentives to MSMEs. More emphasis shall be \nlaid on products and process standards and quality certifications by upgrading \nexisting labs at par with national ones. \n2. Exporters shall be provided access to information regarding various Export Policies \nof the Government and incentives being offered from time to time. An online trade \nportal on the official website of Chandigarh Administration shall be crated to facilitate \ninterested buyers and exporters.  \n3. Mechanism needs to be developed to allow timely credit of GST to the Exporters. \nProcedure regarding Export Documentation needs to be simplified. Single Window \nSystem for this purpose shall be followed. \n4. Information Technology and services parks existing in the region can be converted to \nSEZ as multi-storeys can be constructed with no limit in the SEZ premises. \nArrangements for Skill development  programmes or training institute, or calibration \nlab, if required, can be set up as per the requirement of the industry.  \n5. Building a trade guide is another alternative to disseminate relevant information \nespecially while targeting potential exporters, Agri-exporters and MSMEs. They \nshould be able to obtain market intelligence to compete better globally as they are \nusually unable to gather such crucial data by themselves due to their fragmented \nnature and lack of knowledge resources available to them. \n6. The Administration shall ensure trade support to the exporters by organizing capacity \nbuilding/orientation workshops, preferably in partnership with institutes of foreign \ntrade and management, to help exporters avail benefits from potential export market \nopportunities. \n \n7. A Grievance Redressal cell shall be constituted to address the issues being faced by \nthe exporters. A dedicated website can be created, where links of various \ndepartments can be placed along with simplified export related FAQs, procedures \nand flowcharts could also be placed. Inter departmental coordination along with live \ninteractions can be planned. Launching of specific mobile application to resolve \nexporters’ issues and problems can also be explored. \n \n8. Production of power supply need to be enhanced  and un-interrupted  supply shall be \nmade available to the export industry in the city.  Issues related to the quality of \npower supply about fluctuations, line disruptions, untimely repair & maintenance of \nUploaded on 15-04-2021 \n \nlines, lower voltage, also needs to be taken care off.  \n9. International connectivity  from the city airport and air cargo facilities needs to be \nimproved. Exporters from the city often depend on Delhi Int’l Airport for global \nconsignments as flights from Chandigarh airport have limited air transport \nconnectivity. An air customs station at the city airport should be set-up to cater to the \nspecialized needs of air-borne cargo on similar lines of a dry port. \n10. The Administration shall encourage more exporters to be a part of state export \ncouncils by undertaking active membership drives, organizing investor summits, and \nsigning MoUs with private institutions. \n11. There is an urgent need to set-up a dry port at the outskirts of the city may be setup \nand feasibility for establishing a Multi-Modal Logistics Hub may also be explored. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHANDIGARH EXPORT PLAN \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Number 360/2018 to \ncheck compliance with several statutory requirements related to waste and environment \nmanagement and advisories issued in the states. This order was passed in response to the \ngrowing concerns regarding non-compliance with the provisions of Waste Management Rules \nand Regulations of 2016, and other relevant rules and regulations related to water quality and \nconservation, and air and noise pollution management in the states. Central Pollution Control \nBoard (CPCB) summarized 7 themes from the order of 26thSeptember 2019 that had directed \nthe state governments to compile information with reference to the following specific thematic \nareas viz.:  \n1. Waste Management: \n \n▪ \nSolid Waste \n▪ \nBiomedical Waste \n▪ \nConstruction & Demolition Waste \n▪ \nHazardous Waste \n▪ \nE-Waste \n▪ \nPlastic Waste \n \n2. Water Quality Management. \n \n3. Ambient Air Quality. \n \n4. Domestic Sewage. \n \n5. Industrial Waste Water. \n \n6. Mining Activity \n \n7. Noise Pollution \n \nThis order has directed that such information is to be furnished to the CPCB \nby the Chief Secretaries of all the States/UTs. This may include current status, desirable level \nof compliance in terms of statutes, and gap between current status and desired levels. The \naction proposal needs to address the gap with an action plan including time lines. The \n2 \n \nDepartment of Environment of all States and Union Territories are required to collect such \nDistrict Environment Plans of their respective States and finalize the ‘State Environment Plan’ \ncovering the specific thematic areas. The action for preparation of State’s Environment Plan \nshall be monitored by the respective Chief Secretaries of States and Administration of UTs. \nBased on the Environment Plans of the States and UTs, the Ministry of Environment and \nForests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and CPCB shall prepare country’s Environment \nPlan accordingly.  \nThus, as per the hearing of Hon’ble NGT on 29.01.2021, the State \nGovernments are required to submit a State Environment Plan (SEP) to take stock of the \ncompliance with the statutory provisions and the action plan to safeguard against health risk \nand environmental degradation. Following this order, the Department of Environment, U.T., \nChandigarh has prepared the DEP by compiling information from Municipal Committee, \nChandigarh; Pollution Control Committee, Chandigarh and Chandigarh Smart City Limited as \nper the seven thematic areas. Being a Union Territory, State Environment Plan & District \nEnvironment Plan shall be same for Chandigarh. \n \nThe \nDistrict \nMagistrate, \nU.T. \nChandigarh \nvide \nMemo \nNo. \nDM/MA/2021/3733, dated 25.02.2021 has appointed the A.D.A. posted in the office of the \nDistrict Magistrate as the Nodal Officer w.r.t. the order dated 29.01.2021, passed by the \nHon’ble N.G.T. in the case- “O.A. no. 360 of 2018.

All the health care facilities have \nregistered themselves with Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee for authorization \nunder Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016. One Bio-medical Waste Treatment \nFacility (BMWTF) is authorized by CPCC for collection, transportation, treatment & \ndisposal of the bio-medical waste of Healthcare Facilities of Chandigarh.  \n \n(v) Hazardous Waste Management \nPresently, there are 1236 units (including Standalone DG sets) generating \nHazardous Waste in Chandigarh. Whole of the hazardous waste is collected and \ntransported through authorized Treatment Storage Disposal Facility (TSDF), \nincinerator and recyclers to their facilities located in Punjab, Haryana and U.P. For \ndisposal of landfill able waste, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee has made \nagreement with Punjab Pollution Control Board for utilizing their TSDF facility namely \nM/s Re Sustainability Limited (Formerly known as M/s Ramky Enviro Engineers Ltd.  \n \n(vi) Electronic Waste (E-waste) Management \n \nE-waste generated in Chandigarh is being collected, segregated, dismantled, \nrecycled, treated and disposed off through authorised E-waste recyclers from the other \nstates of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh as there are no dismantlers or recyclers in \nChandigarh. \n \nAir Quality Management \n \nThere are three real time ambient air quality monitoring stations installed by \nChandigarh Pollution Control Committee, U.T. Chandigarh at sector 25, 22 and 53 to \nmonitor the ambient air pollutants in the city. Additionally, there are five manual \nmonitoring stations installed different locations of the city. As per the orders of Hon'ble \nNational Green Tribunal (NGT), Air Quality Monitoring Committee (AQMC) has been \nconstituted in Chandigarh to monitor the air quality management under National Clean \n7 \n \nAir Programme. \n \nWater Quality Management \n \nUnder the National Water Monitoring Programme, CPCC is monitoring ground \nwater, drains and lake as per the schedule decided by CPCB. The present water supply \nservice area of Municipal Corporations Chandigarh (MCC) is 114 Sq. Km, which \nincludes MCC area of 79.34 Sq. Km and rural area of 34.69 Sq. Km. The rural area \ncomprises of 13 villages overseen by the Engineering Department. The water supply to \nthe villages is provided with tube wells in and around the villages. Other urban/rural \nareas have water source of 87MGD (Millions of Gallons per day) from Bhakra Main \nCanal which is 27 km away from Chandigarh and 20 MGD from 230 tube-well located \nin the city. \n \nMining Activity Management Plan \n \nThere is no major mining activity in Chandigarh. \n \n \n     Noise Pollution Management Plan \nChandigarh Administration is divided the various parts of Chandigarh into \ndifferent zones i.e. Industrial Area, Commercial Area, Residential Area and Silence \nZone. The noise levels are maintained at these locations as per Noise Pollution \n(Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n1.0 District Profile: \nChandigarh was planned by the famous French architect Le Corbusier. \nPicturesquely located at the foothills of Shivaliks, it is known as one of the best experiments \nin urban planning and modern architecture in the twentieth century in India. Chandigarh \nderives its name from the temple of \"Chandi Mandir\" located in the vicinity of the site selected \nfor the city. The deity 'Chandi', the goddess of power and a fort of 'garh' laying beyond the \ntemple gave the city its name \"Chandigarh-The City Beautiful\".  \nSince the medieval through modern era, the area was part of the large and \nprosperous Punjab Province which was divided into East & West Punjab during partition of \nthe country in 1947. The city was conceived not only to serve as the capital of East Punjab, \nbut also to resettle thousands of refugees who had been uprooted from West Punjab.In March, \n1948, the Government of Punjab, in consultation with the Government of India, approved the \narea of the foothills of the Shivaliks as the site for the new capital. The location of the city site \nwas a part of the erstwhile Ambala district as per the 1892-93 gazetteer of District Ambala. \nThe foundation stone of the city was laid in 1952. Subsequently, at the time of \nreorganization of the state on 01.11.1966 into Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pardesh, the city \nassumed the unique distinction of being the capital city of both, Punjab and Haryana while it \nitself was declared as a Union Territory and under the direct control of the Central Government. \nThe Master Plan of UT Chandigarh covers an area of approximately 114 sq km \n(excluding 26 km area of Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary). This includes the nearly fully developed \n70 sq km of the area planned by Le Corbusier and his team and the 44 sq km of its 3% share of \nthe 16 km periphery-controlled area. The 44 sq km periphery area of Chandigarh is regulated \nby the Punjab New Periphery Control Act, 1952 with the exception of the abadideh of the \nvillages falling within it namely Sarangpur, Khudda Ali Sher, Khudda Jassu, Khudda Lahora, \nMaloya, Dadumajra,Palsora, Kajheri, Raipur Kalan, Raipur Khurd, Behlana, Hallomajra, \nMakhanmajra, Kishangarh and Manimajra. The area also includes the three natural rivulets of \nthe Patiala Ki Rao, N-Choe and the Sukhna Choe. As per the exact cartographic extent, \nChandigarh is from30°40′N to 30º47'30\"N and from 76°42′15\"E to 76º51'E.  It has an average \nelevation of 320 metres and shares its borders with the states of Haryana and Punjab. \nThe Union Territory of Chandigarh is located in the foothills of the Shivalik hill \nranges in the north, which form a part of the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. It is occupied by \n9 \n \nKandi (Bhabhar) in the north east and Sirowal (Tarai) and alluvial plains in the remaining part. \nThe subsurface formation comprises of beds of boulders, pebbles, gravel, sand, silt, clays and \nsome kankar. The area is drained by two seasonal rivulets viz. Sukhna Choe in the east and \nPatiala-Ki-Rao Choe in the west. The central part forms a surface water divide and has two \nminor streams. The stream passing through the central part is called N-Choe and the other is \nChoe Nala which initiates at Sector29. \nThere are two Eco Sensitive Zones notified in the Union Territory of \nChandigarh, namely Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary Eco Sensitive Zone and City Bird Sanctuary \nEco Sensitive Zone. The extent of zone for the former varies from 2.0 kilometres to 2.75 \nkilometres from the boundary of the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary in the city. The Administration \nhas divided the Eco-sensitive Zone in two zones i. e., Zone-I and Zone II. The extent of Zone-\nI is upto 0.5 km of from the boundary of the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary and the balance area \nshall be in Zone-II and this has been done with the purpose of having stricter norms in Zone-I \nfor protection of wildlife habitat. The area of Eco-sensitive Zone is 1050.0 hectares (on the side \nof Union territory of Chandigarh). The Central Government has also notified an area to an \nextent varying from 80 to 125 meters from the boundary of the City Bird Sanctuary Union \nTerritory Chandigarh as the City Bird Sanctuary Eco-Sensitive Zone. \nWith total area of 140 sq. km, Chandigarh is blessed with 63.03 sq. km. of green \ncover which is 50.05% of UT's total area.

This waste consists of wet, \ndry and horticulture waste from households. The status of management of solid can \nbriefly be discussed as below: \n• \nCollection and Transportation of Segregated Waste \nMCC has engaged 524 GPS installed compartmentalized vehicles for door-to-door \ncollection and transportation of segregated waste (wet, dry and domestic hazardous). \nAdequate no. of triple bin dustbins has been procured and installation work is going on. \nAt present, around 96% of door-to-door collection of segregated waste has been \nachieved.  \n• \nCollection and Transportation of Waste Generated by Bulk Waste Generators \n(BWGs) \n21 nos. BWGs have been identified in the city and all are managing their wet waste \nwithin their premises. Only dry waste is disposed through MCC.  \n• \nManagement of Domestic Hazardous Waste \nWhole of the hazardous waste collected is transported to a collection point at landfill \nsite. Currently vehicles of MCC are taking the domestic hazardous waste separately in \nits vehicles and MCC has executed an agreement with M/s Nimbua Greenfield Punjab \nand M/s Re-sustainability Ltd. for processing of hazardous waste. \n \n \n13 \n \n• \nManagement of Horticulture Waste \nAerobic composting of the horticulture waste has been started in 65 parks/ green belts \nof Chandigarh. All the other green belt areas are practicing onsite anaerobic composting. \nMCC has hired 20 tractor trolleys to lift horticulture waste. \n• \nProcessing and Disposal of Waste \nThere is one Municipal Solid Waste processing plant which was set up by M/s Jai \nPrakash Associates at Dadumajra having capacity 500 TPD. The city has two wet waste \nprocessing facilities; the first is a composting facility of rated capacity of 300 TPD and \nsecond is biomethanation unit of 5 TPD. The composting facility is processing 100 TPD \nof wet waste as on date. Meanwhile, MCC has made necessary arrangements so that the \nwet waste generated everyday is processed immediately and 03 Nos. mechanical MRFs \nare operational.  \n• Bio-remediation of Legacy Waste \nThe work for remediation of 5 Lakh Ton Legacy Waste was commenced under \nChandigarh Smart City Limited and the Bio-remediation work has been completed.  \nCurrently the area cleaning and levelling is in progress.  No fresh waste is being dumped \nat the legacy waste site. 20 Acres of the land will be reclaimed after bioremediation of \nthe legacy waste. \n• Chandigarh is processing its floral waste which is collected daily from temples across \nthe city, into incense sticks, earthen diyas and cones. The project dovetails both National \nUrban Livelihoods Mission (NULM) and Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) as women Self \nHelp Group (SHGs) have been trained to make these products thereby providing them \nthe livelihood.  \n• Chandigarh rose to 12th spot from 66th in 2022 Swachh Survekshan and declaration for \n2023 Swachh Survekshan will be held on Jan-2024. \n• Govt. of India has awarded Chandigarh as best performer among Union Territories in \nSafai Mitra Suraksha Challenge 2021. \n• Chandigarh is one of the very few cities which is processing 100% of its sanitary waste.  \n14 \n \na.

As the numbers of agricultural \nland holdings are very few, the use of harmful chemicals that have potent lethal effects on \nland and water is very much under control. Thus the water quality of Chandigarh lies well \nwithin limits as prescribed by the BIS standards of drinking water. Water analysis conducted \nby the Central Ground Water Board in both deep and shallow aquifers shows the absence of \nheavy metals and any such impurities. \nThe present water supply service area of Municipal Corporations Chandigarh \n(MCC) is 114 Sq.Km, which includes MCC area of 79.34 Sq.Km and rural area of 34.69 \nSq.Km. The urban area falls in jurisdiction of Municipal Corporation and the water supply \nsystem is entrusted to Public Health Wing of MCC. The rural area comprises of 13 villages \noverseen by the Engineering Department. The water supply to the villages is provided with \ntube wells in and around the villages. Other urban/rural areas have water source of 87MGD \n(Millions of Gallons per day) from Bhakra Main Canal which is 27 km away from \nChandigarh and 20 MGD from 230 tube-well located in the city. \n \nChandigarh is recipient to heavy rainfall during the months from July to \nSeptember and receives an average rainfall of 1059.3 mm, which is calculated to be \napproximately 60380.1 million liters or 13241 gallons or 36.28 MGD per annum. It is this \nwater source that helps in recharging of ground water and various confined/ unconfined \naquifers. The demand for water in Chandigarh has increased considerably owing to its \nhighly dense population structure. It is estimated that by 2026, the water demand will be \n523.41 (Millions of liters per day) MLD (116.31 MGD) that is about 22.73% higher than \nthe 2011 demand of 426.50 MLD (94.78 MGD). This is due to excessive pumping of water \nthan the required replenishment. As a result, the ground water levels of deep aquifers in \n64 \n \nChandigarh have been suppressed on an average of 4m in 6 years at different locations \nthroughout the city. \n65 \n \nWater Quality Monitoring \na.

It is important to \nnote that the intention behind laying \nthe sewer line is to address the NGT \nissue without changing the colony's \nillegal status. \nb. The Executive Engineer clarified that \nthe \nMunicipal \nCorporation \nChandigarh is allowed to do work \ninside the \"Lal Dora\" area only and is \nrestricted to carry out work outside \nthe \"Lal Dora\" area. But, as the matter \nrelates to \ncompliance of NGT \nguidelines, he proposed a plan that \nnecessitates a 7-meter wide strip of \n77 \n \nland on both sides of the choe for the \ninstallation of the main sewer line. \nAdditionally, land is also required for \nthe construction of a sewerage sump, \nwhich would serve as the point from \nwhere waste is pumped into the main \nsewer line for treatment at the STP \nDiggian. The land will be made \navailable for execution of work free \nof cost to the Municipal Corporation \nChandigarh. \n \nc. In response to point (b), the residents \nhave requested some time to consider \nthe proposal and will revert back with \ntheir decision. \nd. The \nSub \nDivisional \nMagistrate \nintimated that if the waste water \ncontinues to flow into the choe, they \nwill have no alternative but to proceed \nwith the demolition of the illegal \nconstruction on the agricultural land, \nin compliance with the Hon’ble NGT \norder.  \ne.

The sensitivity of the \nmatter was also apprised to all concerned. The major shortcoming in the action \nplan was highlighted before the Committee which are as follows: \n Authorisation to all the Health Care Facilities (HCFs) \n Implementation of Bar Code System for the management of biomedical \nwaste in Chandigarh. \n Gap analysis w.r.t. biomedical waste generation and disposal \n Liquid waste management in HCFs \n \n \nNodal Officer apprised that Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee \n(CPCC) has granted authorisation to around 719 nos. of HCFs out of total 858 \nnos. of HCFs. It was decided that the remaining HCFs will be issued final show \ncause notice by CPCC before proceeding for the confirmation of directions under \nMinutes of the District Committee for Biomedical Waste Management \nSection 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Director Health Services was \nasked to convene a meeting with the remaining HCFs those who have not taken \nauthorisation from CPCC under Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016. \nMunicipal Corporation Chandigarh was asked to implement the Biomedical \nWaste Management Rules, 2016 by picking up the domestic biomedical waste in \nseparate containers from the household level and make an agreement with \nCommon Biomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility (CBWTF) for the \ndisposal of collected household biomedical waste. Nodal Officer also apprised to \nthe Committee members that presently Chandigarh city is generating around 3400 \nkilograms of biomedical waste per day which will not touch the figures of 6000 \nkilograms per day in next ten years. The present treatment capacity of the \nBiomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility is 6000 kgs. of biomedical \nwaste per day. Hence, there is no gap in the generation and disposal of \nbiomedical waste in Chandigarh. It was also apprised that most of the \ngovernment hospitals are in the process of tendering for the installation of \neffluent treatment plant (ETP) and implementation of bar code management \nsystem in their hospitals. During the meeting it was decided that all the hospitals \nwill be asked to speed up the process of installation of ETPs and Bar Code \nManagement System. \n \n \nThe meeting ended with thanks to the chair. \n \n \nDistrict Magistrate \nU.T.

This is rainfall \nperennial lake and serves as natural water storage during the monsoon \nseason. It falls within the Reserve Forest Area of Patiala-Ki-Rao, UT. \nChandigarh, the map has been shown in (Figure 1) and location of the \nwater body Latitude-30°45'59.50\"N Longitude-76°45'25.53\"E. This water \nbody is in the jurisdiction of Department of forest & wildlife, UT \nChandigarh. The Dhanas Lake is a picturesque water body that has \nplenty to offers its visitors. \n \n Fig.1: Map of Dhanas Lake \n \nElevation- 342 m\n \nPage 4  \n \n \n Hydrological description of water body and Catchment Description \n \nThe inflow of water is coming from forest area & Post \nGraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), UT \nChandigarh and the depth of water during monsoon period remains 7 m \nand Non-monsoon period 4 m. The impounded water is basically used for \nrecreation and Conservation of aquatic biodiversity. The discharge of \nwater flow destination is in the Patiala Ki Rao Reserved Forest. The total \npopulation living around the water body is 7,094 as per 2011 census and \nthe regular footfall of the people in this Lake is approx 1,000 persons per \nday. \n However, the use of Lake is to protect Bio-diversity but the major \npollution in the lake is improper disposal of Sewage Water, silting & \nWeeding.

The floating plant has a total of 34 photovoltaic of 300 \nwatts each. The plant has been set up on a platform that includes a large \nouter ring that floats on water, and grid supporting 34 panels which are \narranged on 7 rows in a hexagonal pattern. A propulsion system has also \nbeen fitted for keeping the panels in line with the direction of the sun. The \nbenefits of the Solar panels in this lake is to Improves water quality; \nReduces algae and removes phosphorus; Aeration breaks down \nunwanted bacteria; Decrease mosquito activity; Removes foul odor from \nLake or Pond; Enhances fish habitat & Improves efficiency of panels due \nto cooling effect of water. However, the Bio Remediation is also being \ndone from wastewater which further beautifies the lake and there are no \nindustrial estates surrounding of Dhanas Lake, UT Chandigarh  \n \nFig.2:- Photovoltaic Floating Solar Plant \n \nPage 7  \n \n \n \n        \n       Fig.3:- Working Solar Fountain \n \nFig.4:- Dhanas Reserved Forest \n \n \n \nPage 8  \n \n \n Adoption of Lake or Pond Restoration Techniques  \n \n1. \nBiological Method to clean lake:- The department will use biological \nmethod to clean the lake by using the rice straw, iron ores and \nSaccharum munja Grasses through methods of bio-remediation and \nwater health indicator such as BOD, DO, COD, PH etc. will regularly \nmeasured for better upkeep of the water body.  \n2. \nStone pitching at the bank of Choe:- It is needed on steep slopes of \nthe lake. This technique involves large interlocking of stones, with their \nflattest side up to create small irregular steps that blend into the \nlandscape. This method is particularly useful on slopes with a massive \nseepage problem, in flood-prone areas. \n3. \nSolar Plant:- The Department of Forests & Wildlife intends to install a \nSolar Plant of 01 MW with the help of CREST, which will help in \ngenerating the clean energy. Solar power is a great way to reduce the \ncarbon footprint and meaningfully contribute towards environment \nconservation. The process of aeration to bring the water and air into \nclose contact in order to remove dissolved gases, such as carbon \ndioxide, and to oxidize dissolved metals such as iron and it will also used \nto remove volatile organic chemicals (VOC) in the water. \n4. \nSeasonal Vegetation:- Planned for seasonal vegetation which helps to \nclean the atmosphere.  However, Seasonal Vegetation plays a critical \nregulatory role in carbon cycling and reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions. Seasonal vegetation at Dhanas Lake will include Flowering \nBeds, Native Green Grass/ Trees, Shrubs, etc.    \n \n \n \nPage 9  \n \n \n \n5. \nImprovement on Walk Track at the water body:-  The walk track will \nbe modified facilitating the general public/walkers.  \n6. \nInstallation of Entry gate, Exit gate and chain link fence:- The \nDepartment will install two gates one for entry and another for exit with \nsecurity guards. A Chain link fence around the lake will be installed, so \nthat the public will enter in the lake through a specific point only. \n7. \nInstallation of Drinking Water facility and Dustbin for Garbage:- \nThere is need for installation of Drinking Water facility at Dhanas Lake \nfor the visitor and bins to keep the lake neat and clean.  \n8.  \nWater Quality:- To reach BOD from average value of 8 mg/l to less than \n5mg/l by March, 2022. \n \n \n \nPage \n10 \n \n \n \n Restoration Form \n  \n \nThe Superintending Engineer, Construction Circle-II, UT. \nChandigarh, vide letter

vehicles (EVs) contributes to a wide range of sustainability goals. These \ninclude better air quality, reduced noise pollution, enhanced energy security, and reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions among others. With vehicular pollution being a growing source of air \npollution in Chandigarh and contributing substantially to particulate pollution in city, rapid adoption \nof zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles is essential. \nThe government adopted the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV (FAME) scheme . \nThe low penetration of electric vehicles is largely due to four critical barriers: \na) High upfront purchase price of EVs \nb) Limited EV product offerings comparable to ICE vehicles \nc) Inadequate public charging infrastructure \nd) Low levels of awareness about EVs and their benefits. \n \nThe slow uptake of EVs and the changing policy, technology, and market landscape have created a \nneed for the Chandigarh Administration to draft its EV Policy, in order to accelerate EV adoption in \nthe UT. This policy prioritizes public and shared transport, goods carriers and two-wheelers to drive \nadoption of EVs. \n \n1. Definitions \n1.1 Electric Vehicle (EV) \nAll vehicles with advanced batteries (both fixed and swappable) having passed all the \neligibility and testing conditions as specified under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of \n(Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME-II) scheme AND purchased & registered in \nChandigarh shall be eligible for incentives. Any conditions/specifications/inclusions/exclusions \nother than FAME II are either specified in this policy or shall be separately notified by CREST \nfrom time to time. \n1.2 Retrofit Kits \nRetrofit kits eligible for incentives under this policy include kits for conversion from ICE to \nadvanced battery-operated Electric Vehicles and shall be approved by a competent agency \nunder Rule 126 of CMVR, 1989 or as notified by the Transport Department, Chandigarh \nGovernment. \n1.3 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)  \nElectric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) shall mean an element in Electric Vehicle (EV) \ncharging infrastructure that supplies electric energy for recharging the battery of Electric \nVehicles. EVSE shall be type tested by an agency/lab accredited by National Accreditation \nBoard for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL)/ Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) from \ntime to time. \n2. Vision, Mission, Objectives \n2.1 Vision \nTo enable zero emission mobility adoption for achieving carbon neutrality in Chandigarh by \n2030. \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n2.2 Mission \nTo provide an enabling framework through incentives and initiatives for promoting zero \nemission mobility with societal, economic and environmental considerations at forefront. \n \n2.3 Policy Objectives  \nTo accelerate adoption of EVs in the UT so that they contribute to 70% of new vehicle \nregistrations by the end of policy period. \n \n \nTo support adoption of Electric Vehicles in every vehicle category prioritizing phase-wise \ntransition with following targets: \n*It is to be noted that the internal combustion engine vehicles of each category as specified above \nwill have only leftover percentage of quota of the target table above on YOY bases for registration in \nChandigarh \n \nTo establish Chandigarh as a ‘Model EV City’ by achieving one of the highest penetration \nof Zero Emission Vehicles amongst all Indian cities, by the end of policy period as \ndefined in Clause 3 \n \nTo leverage the cycling track infrastructure of city for promoting usage of Electric \nBicycles as a replacement of 2/4W especially for short trips \n \nTo establish wide network of Charging points by enabling availability of power supply \nand related processes  \n \nTo harness the New & Renewable Energy sources for charging of EVs to positively \nimpact the indirect emissions \n \nTo enable fleet operators like E-commerce companies, last-mile delivery/logistics \nplayers and mobility aggregators transition to zero emission vehicles \n \nTo nurture skill development, R&D and startup for electric mobility space in the UT. \nCategory \nTarget  \n(Share of EVs in new vehicle registrations by the end of policy period) \nYear-1 \nYear-2 \nYear-3 \nYear-4 \nYear-5 \ne-2W \n35% \n70% \n100% \ne-3W (Passenger \nAutos) \n100% \n100% \n100% \ne-3W (Goods) \n20% \n40% \n60% \n80% \n100% \ne-4W Goods \n20% \n40% \n60% \n80% \n100% \ne-Cars - Personal \n10% \n20% \n30% \n40% \n50 % \ne Cars -Commercial \n(Local Permit) \n20% \n40% \n60% \n80% \n100% \ne Buses \n40% \n50% \n80% \n90% \n100% \nElectric/Alternate \nFuel \nCharging \nInfrastructure \nSetting up of 100 charging station across UT by covering at least 1 charging \nstation in every parking. \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \nTo develop a communication plan focused on driving awareness regarding the key \nelements of this policy and the benefits of adopting EVs \n3. Policy Period \nThe policy shall be valid for a period of 5 years from the date of notification with a detailed \nreview to be undertaken annually or as required. The incentives shall be extended only for \nthe policy period unless otherwise stated/notified. \n \n4.

INTRODUCTION\n\nSports is microcosm of life; and it will not be an exaggeration to state that the values of a\nnation could be judged through the quality of ethos, commitment and discipline perpetuated\nby her sportspersons. The astonishing charisma of Sports acts as glue to gel people of\ndifferent hues in a single thread of unbridled joy in seeing their athletes and players compete\nto best of their abilities and bringing laurels in form of Medals & Trophies.\n\nThis high power accrues to a sport from a bottomless well of unprecedented sacrifice,\nunheard toil, and unseen sweat & blood which a sportsperson sheds during his or her\nunending practice sessions against all odds. Only to make his or her country prouder! No\ndoubt the biggest charm of watching sports is that it is the purest form of duel between two\ncompetitors mandated to exhibit their skill- sets in most genuine, fair and on a rule-based\nregimen. The raw honesty and innate sincerity is the hallmark ofa sportsperson.\n\nSuccess in sports is always hard earned and the triumph of willpower not only feeds\nhumankind's pursuits to win bigger but also nurtures the soul. It teaches discipline, a vital\ningredient to succeed in life in general. An otherwise disciplined person might not be a\nsportsperson, but a sportsperson will always be disciplined. It also instils a sense of\ncooperation, teamwork and collaboration thereby leading to establish a society which is in\nsync with individual and collective aspirations of each other, in line with achievement of\ngreater national goals through citizen camaraderie.\n\nThat Sports bridges across not only national but global differences as well, has been evident\nmore than once with political leaders of eminence taking recourse to Sports Diplomacy, to\nrestore ties of peace & stability, when all other tactics and manoeuvres of governance do not\nyield desired results.\n\nUnrelenting nurturing of this immensely vibrant culture of inspiration through sports,\nrequires a well-researched, efficiently-funded and ably-supported framework in the form of\na Policy Document, known as Sports Policy.\n\nSports Policy is amongst the most vital cogs in nation's efforts to keep producing\nsportspersons of highest merit through equitable availability of resources, to all who aspire\nto be role models for their citizens. A well devised and executed Sports framework acts as a\nstrategic blueprint, automatically sculpting success stories by promoting sports at right\nlevels by seeking to increase participation and sustaining the competitive spirit through\ninnovation and inspiration by providing world class infrastructure, right from the start to all\nbudding sports lovers and citizenry in general. Hence, this Sports Policy!\n\n(Page 3-29) Sports Policy\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n2. BACKGROUND OF CHANDIGARH SPORTS DEPARTMENT\n\nInitially Sports Department was part of Education Department; and to provide it more\nautonomy it was bifurcated subsequently from Education Department in 1982.

TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT OF COACHES\n\nCoaches would be provided regular training by exploring maximum opportunities by\norganizing inter-state/international exchange programs, seminars and talks by the best of\nsubject experts. Selection of Coaches for exchange programs would entail past record of\nconcerned coach and performance of his/her trainees at national and international events in\nlast 3 years.\n\nThere will be coaching exchange programs with network of various elite coaching institute\nworld-wide. The elite coaches will be sent for best coaching institutes in the world for\nimproving their knowledge, skills and to keep them updated with latest trends, training\nmethods and pedagogical skills. Sports Department, Chandigarh Administration believes\nthat learning is a lifelong process for continuous professional development of any\nindividual. In this context, apart from athlete development, strategic coach development by\ntheir exposure to continuous academic & practical learning keeps them abreast with latest\nknowledge in tandem with global changing and innovative coaching trends. Hence Sports\nDepartment, Chandigarh Administration has planned to organise periodical\nrefresher/orientation coaching courses by respective International/National Federations,\nSports Authority of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, Government of India,\nInternational Olympic committee, not only to harness their coaching skills but also their\nexposure to physiological, psychological, sports medicine, nutrition, Long term Athlete\nDevelopment, Training methods etc.\n\nAt the same time, Sports department is concerned that Coaches need to be motivated also by\nawards (Honour and cash) after their appropriate performance appraisal & continuous\nevaluation. Continuous evaluation of coaches will also determine accountability of\ncoaches.\n\n21. SPORTS INJURY & REHABILITATION\n\nSport and injury go hand in hand; and every sportsperson is prone to getting injured which\nmay at worst even threaten his/her career. Government invests in each of the sportsperson\nand injury to a promising sportsperson is also a national loss in terms of loss of talent,\nexperience, training and prospective medals for the country. Quick and timely rehabilitation\ntherefore becomes paramount to mitigate the extent of injury, lessen the impairment and\ntake immediate protective action to ensure against any long-term loss to the sportsperson\nand the nation.\n\nSpecialized Rehabilitation ecosystem, though in a nascent stage in India; it is a fast\ndeveloping one. State of the art Sports Injury and Rehabilitation Centre will be set-up with\nbest of modern technologies and techniques in vogue to ensure our players do not lag behind\nin any respect while preparing for national and international level competitions. Feasibility\nfor investment through Public Private Partnership will be explored for long-term sustenance\nand nurturing of this crucial sporting aspect in the evolving international sporting\nlandscape. To begin with, Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) can be signed with\npremier government institutes.\n\nDomain experts, doctors, physiotherapists would be hired to oversee a science driven\n\nmultidisciplinary approach to ensure the return of the athlete to optimum mathletic function,\nincase ofan injury.\n\n(Page 25-29) Sports Policy\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n22. PSYCHOLOGICAL & MENTAL WELL-BEING\n\nPsychological and mental wellbeing of sportspersons is equally crucial at par with their\nphysical fitness. Culmination of a trainee into a productive, successful, and a world class\nsportsperson depends massively upon his mental and physiological toughness. Given the\never-rising competition level and stress which impacts the performance of athletes, it is\nnecessary to take care of our athletes’ overall wellbeing right through their careers.\n\nThe physical fitness and the skills go haywire if the psychological components of an athlete\nlike fighting spirit, mental toughness, strength management, positive attitude, self-\nconfidence, self-reliance and optimism etc. do not complement the physical, physiological,\ntechnical and tactical traits and components of any sports person pursuing sports for high\nperformance in a competitive environment. The psychological build-up of an athlete can\nalso be nurtured with systematic and pro-active training involving qualified sports\npsychologists and harnessing the support systems and physical & mental activities like\nyoga, meditation which also help in physiological and psychological fitness, focus and\nconcentration, conditioned body metabolism, mental relaxation and the ability to deliver the\nbest of an athlete without fear and apprehension of the outcome of a competition as all\npsychological and mental training train a person for optimum level of anxiety to perform\nmeticulously in competitive environment.\n\nTo achieve this end, a dedicated Wellbeing Centre will be set up for which Public Private\nPartnership model will be explored. Initially, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical\nEducation & Research Sector 12 Chandigarh can be taken on board through an\nMemorandum of Understanding (MoU) till the specialized Centre is established.\n\n23. PREVENTION OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE\n\nTo effectively negate and combat likelihood of substance abuse by sportspersons, a\nCommittee under supervision of Joint Director Sports with District Sports Officer, a Senior\nCoach of the Department and representative of Director Health Services, Chandigarh\nAdministration as Members would oversee regular conduct of surprise drug testing checks\nboth during the Championships/Tournaments and during the off time.\n\nDepartment would also hold across the year awareness programmes to spread awareness\nabout substance abuse and its harmful impact on sportspersons. Concerted efforts would be\nmade to harmonise anti-doping policies mandated by World Anti-doping Agency (WADA)\nand National Anti-doping Agency (NADA)into the rules and regulations of the Department\nto ensure stringent compliance.\n\nSports Policy (Page 26-29)\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n24. STAKEHOLDERS’ ENGAGEMENT\n\nStakeholders are individuals, groups or organizations that have vested interest or concern in\na particular project, business or organization. Stakeholders are important because they can\nprovide essential support, influence decision making, hold an organization accountable,\npromote innovation and creativity and contribute to long term success. Thus, identification\nand engagement of stakeholders is very important and critical for an organization.\n\nThis Sports Policy recognises the importance and relevance of various stakeholders in\npromoting sports in the City and envisages working with them in synergy.\n\nChandigarh Sports Department keeps a vision for team work with all its stakeholders viz.\nAthletes/Participants, Parents/Guardians, Coaches, Support Staff, Officials, Chandigarh\nSports Council, Education Department, Chandigarh, Educational Institutions in the City,\nPrivate Sports Academies, Corporates/PSUs, Media, Chandigarh Olympic Associations,\nChandigarh Sports Associations, NGO’s operating in sport sectors, National Sports\nFederations, Administrators, MYAS, GOI/SAI.\n\nThere is dire need of amalgamation of sports with education curriculum and Sports\nDepartment intends to engage with Education Department, U.T. Chandigarh for tapping\nmaximum resources so as to identify sports talent at grass root level and its structured\npathway from grass root to elite level as per Long Term Athlete Development (LTAD)\nprogram.\n\nIn any Sports Development initiative of various Govt. organizations, collaboration with\ncorporate sector has become need of the hour. Sports Department Chandigarh understands\nthe need for participation with Corporate Sector and Public Sector Undertakings by\nproviding policy & programs for sustainable sports development. The Corporates believes\nin and acknowledge their brand development through sports, in terms of 'marketing through\nsport! viz. getting associated with/ sponsorship of various sports events, endorsements etc.\nAt the same time, Sports organizations in the Govt. look beyond their limited financial\nresources. Hence, a PPP (Public Private Partnership) model of Govt. and corporates is a win-\nwin situation for both the sides. Apart from that, the corporate sectors have CSR (Corporate\nSocial Responsibility) initiatives for sports development for social cause and they have\nhuge fund spared for this space in leveraging their potential for sponsorship, endorsements\nunder CSR ambit, for their image/brand development through sports.\n\nTo ensure extreme realization of overall vision of Sports Policy, the role of varied\nstakeholders is critical as harnessing core competence/experience/expertise of each and the\nseamless coherence with them is must in strengthening the Department’s endeavour to\ncreate a cohesive sports ecosystem.\n\n25. WALL OF FAME\n\nTo honour & acknowledge elite sports persons of Chandigarh and to inspire budding\nathletes, a Wall- of- Fame would be created in every sports complex of sports department\nand Government & Private educational institutions, which will be instrumental to generate\nhero worship so that potential athletes emulate the sport legends of yester years.\n\n(Page 27-29) Sports Policy\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n26. DATA BANK OF SPORTSPERSONS\n\nTo further streamline and strengthen department’s player outreach mechanism, an online\ndatabank would be generated with all the required information about our sportspersons.\n\nData-driven evaluation of past performances would be employed to ensure designing of best\nsuited training modules for each and every sportsperson, Sports Department would be\ncollaborating and associating with nodal IT agencies of Chandigarh Administration viz.\nNIC and SPIC for maintenance & up-dation of sports data of sportspersons of for their\ntraining, development, scouting, safeguarding, periodical assessment, monitoring &\nevaluation.\n\n27. INSURANCE FOR ACTIVE SPORTSPERSONS\n\nInjuries are regular feature of a sportsperson’s life and a serious injury may impact not only\nthe sporting performance of the athlete but may also impair him for future life. Under this\npolicy, Department would explore feasibility of tying-up with government and private\ninsurance companies to provide insurance to active sportspersons from all kinds of sports\ninjuries picked up by the athlete while playing or practice. The list of sports covered under\nthis policy for insurance would be issued separately.\n\n28. SPORTS LIBRARY\n\nFeats of past are harbinger of future laurels. Chandigarh is blessed to have an amazing\nrepository of sporting excellence owing to galaxy of stars who have left an indelible mark on\nthe collective sporting psyche of the nation with their commitment, dedication and\nendurance. Stories of stars including Late Sardar Milkha Singh have become part of folklore\nand it is obligatory to transfer that passion to younger generations for harnessing their talent\nwith inspiration.\n\nWith this avowed purpose and to inspire budding sportspersons, a centralized state-of-the-\nart Sports Library would be set up showcasing the vast legacy of past and present sports\nachievements, chronological sports record of eminent sportspersons, highlights of their\nmajor achievements and their message for the youth. Sufficient space for recreational sports\nwould be created to give uninitiated the feel & touch of taking up a sport for the nation!\n\n“Reading is to the mind, what exercise is to the body.” In a sports environment of\nrecreational as well as competitive, a sports person has to be mentally sound in terms of\ncritical and analytical thinking to strategize, organize and plan his optimum transfer of his\npotential and capability on and off the sports field. A well-equipped and tech-savvy library\ncomprising best of the books and journals (digital/ manual) for the players, coaches, officials\nand sports administrators will facilitate all concerned to keep themselves informed &\napprised with the latest attributes of competitive and recreational sport environment.\nChandigarh Sports Dept. will provide the world class library to easy access to all its\nstakeholders.\n\nSports Policy (Page 28-29)\nDEPARTMENT OF SPORTS\n\n29. SPORTS TOURISM\n\nCity Beautiful is endowed with unmatchable and world-renowned aesthetics, enviable-\nserenity and amazing ambience which attracts millions of tourists from across the globe.\nAdding a dash of sports from the point of view of fitness and/or recreational/leisure activity\ninto tour plans of tourists visiting Chandigarh, have the potential of not only sprucing up\nCity’s tourism quotient but also the revenue earnings of the Sports Department.
